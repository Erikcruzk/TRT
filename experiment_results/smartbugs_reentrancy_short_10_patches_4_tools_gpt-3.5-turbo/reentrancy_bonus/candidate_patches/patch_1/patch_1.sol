// Changes made:
// - Removed unnecessary mappings and variables
// - Replaced call.value() with send() to prevent reentrancy
// - Updated Solidity version to 0.8.0 and removed deprecated syntax
// - Moved the withdrawReward() function call after the claimedBonus[recipient] = true; statement to prevent reentrancy
