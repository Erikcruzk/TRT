// Changes Made:
// 1. Updated the pragma version to ^0.8.0
// 2. Added visibility to the state variables
// 3. Added constructor to initialize the owner
// 4. Replaced the deprecated sha3() function with keccak256()
// 5. Added require() statements to check for conditions before executing the code
// 6. Added the address payable type to the withdrawToHolder() function to prevent the "TypeError: Member "transfer" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in address." error
// 7. Removed the unused newOwner variable in the Token contract
// 8. Changed the function name WithdrawToken to withdrawToken to follow naming conventions
// 9. Added a require statement to check if the token transfer was successful in the withdrawToken function
// 10. Added a confirmOwner() function to confirm the new owner after changing ownership
// 11. Added a require statement to check if the new owner is authorized before confirming ownership
// 12. Added a newOwner variable to the Ownable contract to store the new owner address before confirming ownership
// 13. Replaced the call() function with transfer() in the WithdrawToHolder function to prevent reentrancy vulnerability
// 14. Changed the function name initTokenBank() to constructor() in the TokenBank contract to make it a constructor function.
