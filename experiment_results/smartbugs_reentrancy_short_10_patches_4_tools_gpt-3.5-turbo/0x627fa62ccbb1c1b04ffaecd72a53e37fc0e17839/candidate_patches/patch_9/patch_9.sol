// Changes Made:
// - Added visibility modifiers to all state variables
// - Changed the constructor to a constructor function
// - Added a confirmOwner() function to confirm the new owner and prevent reentry attacks
// - Changed the WithdrawToken() function to withdrawToken() and added require statements to check for sufficient balance and successful transfer
// - Changed the Deposit() function to deposit() and added a require statement to check for minimum deposit amount
// - Changed the WitdrawTokenToHolder() function to withdrawTokenToHolder() and added a require statement to check if the holder has a balance to withdraw
// - Changed the WithdrawToHolder() function to withdrawToHolder() and added a require statement to check if the holder has a balance to withdraw and sufficient balance in the contract
// - Changed the version of Solidity to 0.8.0 for better security features
