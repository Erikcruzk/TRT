// Changes Made:
// 1. Updated the Solidity version to ^0.8.0.
// 2. Added constructor to initialize the owner address.
// 3. Changed the function names to follow the naming conventions.
// 4. Added error messages to the require statements.
// 5. Changed the withdraw function to transfer the amount instead of using call.
// 6. Removed the unused variable "owner" from the Token contract.
// 7. Changed the function visibility to external for the receive function.
