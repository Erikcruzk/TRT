Vulnerability: reentrancy-benign found in the following piece of code:

```
    function cancelApprover(string _description)

        external

        nonReentrant

        requireForApprover

    {

        if (now > approverStartDate.safeAdd(5 days)) {

            require(isApprover(msg.sender));

        } else {

            require(msg.sender == approverAddress);

            deployedFromContract.deleteApproverWorkAddress(

                this,

                approverAddress

            );

            deployedFromContract.sendApproverArgonCoin(approverAddress);

        }

        approverConfirmStatus = 2;

        approverReport = _description;

        _payEmployer();

```

The contract is among the source code below:

```
    {
        if (now > approverStartDate.safeAdd(5 days)) {
            require(isApprover(msg.sender));
        } else {
            require(msg.sender == approverAddress);

            deployedFromContract.deleteApproverWorkAddress(
                this,
                approverAddress
            );

            deployedFromContract.sendApproverArgonCoin(approverAddress);
        }

        approverConfirmStatus = 1;
        _payFreelancer();
        approverReport = _description;
        workEndDate = now;
    }

        _payEmployer();
    }

    function autoConfirm() external nonReentrant {
        require(now > freelancerSendFilesDate.safeAdd(5 days));
        require(!employerReceiveFiles);
        require(freelancerSendFiles);
        _payFreelancer();
        deployedFromContract.setPuan(5, freelancerAddress);
        employerRemark = "Auto Confirmed By Smart Contract";

Recommended fix: check-effects-interactions pattern

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
