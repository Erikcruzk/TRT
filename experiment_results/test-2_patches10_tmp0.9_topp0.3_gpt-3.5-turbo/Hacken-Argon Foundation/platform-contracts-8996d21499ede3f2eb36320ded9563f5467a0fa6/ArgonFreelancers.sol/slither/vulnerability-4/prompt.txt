Vulnerability: reentrancy-benign found in the following piece of code:

```
    function confirmApprover(string _description)

        external

        nonReentrant

        requireForApprover

    {

        if (now > approverStartDate.safeAdd(5 days)) {

            require(isApprover(msg.sender));

        } else {

            require(msg.sender == approverAddress);



            deployedFromContract.deleteApproverWorkAddress(

                this,

                approverAddress

            );



            deployedFromContract.sendApproverArgonCoin(approverAddress);

        }



        approverConfirmStatus = 1;

        _payFreelancer();

        approverReport = _description;

        workEndDate = now;

```

The contract is among the source code below:

```
        require(!employerReceiveFiles);
        _payFreelancer();
        deployedFromContract.setPuan(_puan, freelancerAddress);
        employerRemark = _remark;
        employerReceiveFiles = true;
        workEndDate = now;
    }

    function employerCancel(string _depscription) external {
        require(msg.sender == employerAddress);
        require(argonShield);
        require(approverStartDate == 0);
        require(!employerReceiveFiles);
        require(freelancerSendFiles, "freelancer must be sent files");

        approverConfirmStatus = 0;
        employerCancelDescription = _depscription;
        approverStartDate = now;
    }

    function confirmApprover(string _description)
        external

            deployedFromContract.deleteApproverWorkAddress(
                this,
                approverAddress

    }

    function cancelApprover(string _description)
        external
        nonReentrant
        requireForApprover

        approverConfirmStatus = 2;
        approverReport = _description;
        _payEmployer();
    }
```

Recommended fix: check-effects-interactions pattern

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
