// Changes Made:
// 1. Updated the solidity version to ^0.8.0.
// 2. Added a bool variable 'locked' to prevent reentrancy attacks.
// 3. Added a modifier to check if withdrawal is locked.
// 4. Added a check to ensure that the user has sufficient balance before withdrawing.
// 5. Moved the resetting of user balance to after the transfer to prevent a potential reentrancy attack.
// 6. Added a deposit function to allow users to deposit funds into their account.
