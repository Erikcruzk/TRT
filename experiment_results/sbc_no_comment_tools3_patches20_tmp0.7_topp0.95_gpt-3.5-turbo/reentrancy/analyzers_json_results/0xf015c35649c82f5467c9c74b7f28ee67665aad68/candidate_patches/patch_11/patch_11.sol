/**
 * Changes Made:
 * 1. Made the contract name MY_BANK to follow Solidity naming conventions.
 * 2. Moved the Holder struct and Acc mapping to the top for better readability.
 * 3. Made the LogFile variable private and added a constructor to initialize it.
 * 4. Renamed Put and Collect functions to put and collect, respectively, to follow Solidity naming conventions.
 * 5. Added a require statement in collect function to check if the account balance is sufficient and the time lock has expired.
 * 6. Replaced the external call in collect function with a transfer to prevent reentrancy attacks.
 * 7. Renamed Log struct and AddMessage function to log and addMessage, respectively, to follow Solidity naming conventions.
 * 8. Changed the LastMsg variable to a memory variable in addMessage function to fix the reentrancy vulnerability.
 * 9. Made all function visibility modifiers explicit.
 * 10. Made minor changes to variable names and comments for better readability.
