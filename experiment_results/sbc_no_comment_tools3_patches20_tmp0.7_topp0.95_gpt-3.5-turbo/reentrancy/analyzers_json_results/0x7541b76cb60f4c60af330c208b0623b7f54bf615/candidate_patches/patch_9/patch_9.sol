// Changes Made:
// 1. Moved the struct Holder and mapping Acc to the top of the contract as it is a good practice to declare all the state variables at one place.
// 2. Replaced var with Holder storage for better readability and security.
// 3. Added require statement to ensure that the balance is sufficient and the unlockTime has passed before allowing the user to collect funds.
// 4. Replaced the external call with a transfer statement to prevent reentrancy attack.
// 5. Removed the payable modifier from the Collect function as it doesn't need to receive any funds.
// 6. Added memory keyword while declaring LastMsg struct variable in the Log contract.
