// Changes made:
// 1. Added two new functions freezeAccount and unfreezeAccount to allow the contract owner to freeze/unfreeze accounts.
// 2. Added a new mapping to keep track of frozen accounts.
// 3. Changed visibility of all functions to public for accessibility.
// 4. Added require statements to check for frozen accounts and credit balance before withdrawal.
// 5. Moved the credit[msg.sender] -= amount; statement before the external call to prevent reentrancy vulnerability.
// 6. Added assert statement to ensure the external call was successful.
