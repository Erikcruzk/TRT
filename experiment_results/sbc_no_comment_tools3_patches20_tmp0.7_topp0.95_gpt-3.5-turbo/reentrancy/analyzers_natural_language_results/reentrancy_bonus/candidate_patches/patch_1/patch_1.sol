// Changes Made:
// 1. Added a require statement to check if rewardsForA[recipient] is greater than 0 in withdrawReward function to prevent reentrancy vulnerability.
// 2. Moved claimedBonus[recipient] = true; statement before calling the withdrawReward function in getFirstWithdrawalBonus function to prevent reentrancy vulnerability.
