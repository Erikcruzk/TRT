// Changes Made:
// 1. Removed the hardcoded target address and added it as a parameter in the go function.
// 2. Added input validation to check if the target address is not zero and if the value sent is greater than zero.
// 3. Added a bool variable to check if the low-level call was successful.
// 4. Replaced the deprecated syntax for the low-level call with the new syntax.
// 5. Moved the initialization of the owner variable to the constructor.
