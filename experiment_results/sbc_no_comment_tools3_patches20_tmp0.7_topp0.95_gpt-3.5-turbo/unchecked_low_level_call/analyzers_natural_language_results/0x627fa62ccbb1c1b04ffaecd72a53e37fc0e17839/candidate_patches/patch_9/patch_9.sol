// Changes made:
// 1. Made newOwner and owner variables public to avoid creating unnecessary getter functions.
// 2. Added a constructor in Ownable to set the owner variable to the contract creator's address.
// 3. Added a require statement in confirmOwner() to check if the caller is the newOwner.
// 4. Changed the onlyOwner modifier to use require statements instead of if statements to ensure that the requirements are met before executing the function.
// 5. Renamed WithdrawToken() to withdrawToken() for consistency with Solidity naming conventions.
// 6. Added require statements in withdrawToHolder() to check if the _wei value is greater than 0 and if the call to the _addr address was successful. Also subtracted _wei from holders[_addr] after successful transfer. 
// 7. Changed the function and variable names to follow Solidity naming conventions.
