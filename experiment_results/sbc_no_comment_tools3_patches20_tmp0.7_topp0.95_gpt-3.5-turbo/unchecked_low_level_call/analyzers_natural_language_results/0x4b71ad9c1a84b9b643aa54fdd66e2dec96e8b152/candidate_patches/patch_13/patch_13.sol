// Changes Made:
// 1. Added a new argument '_values' which is an array of uint256 values to be transferred to the corresponding addresses in '_tos'.
// 2. Added a require statement to check if the length of '_tos' and '_values' arrays are greater than 0 and if they have equal length.
// 3. Replaced the unchecked low-level call with a checked call that uses the require statement to check if the transfer was successful.
