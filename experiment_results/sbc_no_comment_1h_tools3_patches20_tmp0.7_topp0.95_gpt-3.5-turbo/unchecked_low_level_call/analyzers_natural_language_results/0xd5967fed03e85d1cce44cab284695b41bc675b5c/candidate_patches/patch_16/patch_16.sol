//Changes Made:
//1. Changed the contract name to start with a capital letter to follow naming conventions.
//2. Changed the name of the contract address variable to be more descriptive.
//3. Changed the variable name "v" to "amount" to be more descriptive.
//4. Added require statement to check if the external call was successful and revert the transaction if not.
