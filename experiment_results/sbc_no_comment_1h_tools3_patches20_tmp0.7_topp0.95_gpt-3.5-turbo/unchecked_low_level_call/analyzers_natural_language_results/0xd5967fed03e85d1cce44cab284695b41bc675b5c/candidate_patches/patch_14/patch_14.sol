// Changes made:
// 1. Renamed the contract to start with a capital letter.
// 2. Changed the variable name caddress to tokenAddress to make it more descriptive.
// 3. Changed the variable name v to value to make it more descriptive.
// 4. Added a require statement to check if the transfer was successful.
