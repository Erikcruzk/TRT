// Changes Made:
// 1. Changed Owner to owner for consistency and added a constructor to set the owner.
// 2. Removed the unnecessary address assignment in the withdraw function.
// 3. Renamed GetFreebie to getFreebie for consistency.
// 4. Added a require statement in the command function to check if the external call was successful and prevent reentrancy attacks.
// 5. Removed the vulnerability of unchecked_low_level_call in the command function.
