// Changes Made:
// 1. Made owner and newOwner variables public
// 2. Added constructor to Ownable contract and removed the redundant owner assignment in changeOwner and confirmOwner functions
// 3. Added require statements to confirmOwner and onlyOwner modifiers to avoid unauthorized access
// 4. Changed function name WithdrawToken to withdrawToken to follow naming conventions
// 5. Added require statement to withdrawToken function to check if the token transfer was successful
// 6. Changed function name WithdrawToHolder to withdrawToHolder to follow naming conventions
// 7. Added require statements to withdrawToHolder function to check if the holder has sufficient balance and if the transfer was successful
// 8. Changed MinDeposit to minDeposit to follow naming conventions
