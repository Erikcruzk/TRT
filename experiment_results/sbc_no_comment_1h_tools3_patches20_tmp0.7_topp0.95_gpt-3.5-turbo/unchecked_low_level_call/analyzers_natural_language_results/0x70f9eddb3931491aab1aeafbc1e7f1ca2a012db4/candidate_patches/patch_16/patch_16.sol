// Changes Made:
// - Added a constructor to set the Owner address
// - Renamed GetHoneyFromJar to getHoneyFromJar to follow Solidity naming conventions
// - Removed the condition that sets Owner to a specific address in withdraw function
// - Renamed Command to command to follow Solidity naming conventions
// - Added a require statement to check the return value of the external call in command function to prevent unchecked low-level call vulnerability.
