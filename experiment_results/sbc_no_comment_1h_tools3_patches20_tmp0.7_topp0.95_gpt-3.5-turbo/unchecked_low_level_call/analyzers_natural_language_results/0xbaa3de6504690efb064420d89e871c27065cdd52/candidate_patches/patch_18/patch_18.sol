// Changes Made:
// 1. Removed duplicate 'Owner' variable in VaultProxy contract
// 2. Added constructor to both contracts for setting owner
// 3. Added require statements for checking valid inputs and return values of external calls in proxy function
// 4. Added fallback function to VaultProxy for depositing ether
// 5. Changed 'Deposits' mapping to 'deposits' for consistency with Solidity naming conventions
// 6. Added require statements for checking valid inputs and available balance in withdraw function.
