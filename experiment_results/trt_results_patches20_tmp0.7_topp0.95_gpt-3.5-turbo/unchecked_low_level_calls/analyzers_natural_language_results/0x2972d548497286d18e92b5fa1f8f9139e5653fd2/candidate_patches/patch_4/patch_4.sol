// Changes Made:
// 1. Renamed the contract to start with an uppercase letter, following naming conventions
// 2. Renamed the variables to be more descriptive
// 3. Added a require statement to check that the length of the "to" array is greater than 0 and equal to the length of the "value" array
// 4. Added a require statement to check the return value of the external call and revert the transaction if it fails. This addresses the unchecked_low_level_calls vulnerability.
