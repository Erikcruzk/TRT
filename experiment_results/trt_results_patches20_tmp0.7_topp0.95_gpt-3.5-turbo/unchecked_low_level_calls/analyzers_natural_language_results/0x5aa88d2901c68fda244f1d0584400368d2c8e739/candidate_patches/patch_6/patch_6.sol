// Changes Made:
// 1. Changed variable name Owner to owner to follow Solidity naming conventions.
// 2. Removed unnecessary payable keyword from withdraw function.
// 3. Renamed Command function to execute and added input parameters for better clarity.
// 4. Added require statement to check the return value of execute function call.
// 5. Added require statement to check if the target address for multiplicate function is not null.
// 6. Changed the logic of multiplicate function to multiply the value of input ether by 3 and transfer it to the target address.
