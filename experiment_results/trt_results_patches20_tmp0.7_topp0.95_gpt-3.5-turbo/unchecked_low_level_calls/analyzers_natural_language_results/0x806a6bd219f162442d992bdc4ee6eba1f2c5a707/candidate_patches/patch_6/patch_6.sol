/**
 * @title Pie
 * @dev This contract represents a pie store where users can purchase pies using ether and the owner can withdraw the funds.
 * This contract has been updated to address the following vulnerabilities:
 * 1. The owner address was not initialized in the constructor and could be set to an arbitrary address.
 * 2. The fallback function was deprecated in favor of receive().
 * 3. The GetPie function did not check for sufficient ether provided and did not correctly transfer ether to the buyer.
 * 4. The withdraw function did not correctly transfer ether to the new owner after changing the owner address.
 * 5. The Command function did not check for successful external calls.
