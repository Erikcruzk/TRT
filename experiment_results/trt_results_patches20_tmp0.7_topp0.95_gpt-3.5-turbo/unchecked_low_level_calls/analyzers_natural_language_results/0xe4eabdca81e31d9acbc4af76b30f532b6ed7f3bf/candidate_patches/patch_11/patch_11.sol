// Changes Made:
// 1. Changed variable name Owner to owner to follow Solidity naming conventions
// 2. Removed "payable" modifier from withdraw function as it does not need to receive any value
// 3. Added a require statement to check the return value of the external call in command function to avoid unchecked low-level calls vulnerability.
