// Changes Made:
// 1. Renamed Owner variable to owner with a lowercase 'o' for consistency.
// 2. Removed unnecessary if condition from the withdraw function and added a require statement to check if the caller is the owner.
// 3. Added a require statement to check the return value of the external function call in the Command function to prevent unchecked low-level calls vulnerability.
