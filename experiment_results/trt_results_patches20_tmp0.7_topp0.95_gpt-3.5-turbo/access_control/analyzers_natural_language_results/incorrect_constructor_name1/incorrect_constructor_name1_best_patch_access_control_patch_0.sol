// Changes made:
// 1. Renamed the contract to a valid name
// 2. Renamed the function IamMissing to a constructor, which is invoked only once during the contract deployment
// 3. Changed the fallback function from public to external and removed the function name
// 4. Changed the function withdraw to use the address(this) syntax to get the contract's balance and updated the function modifier to onlyOwner for better security.
