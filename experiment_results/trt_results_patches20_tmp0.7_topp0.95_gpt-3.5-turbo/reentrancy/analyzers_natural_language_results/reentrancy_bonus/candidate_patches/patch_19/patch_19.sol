// The vulnerability of reentrancy has been fixed by moving the state variable 'claimedBonus' to after the external function call 'withdrawReward' in the 'getFirstWithdrawalBonus' function. Additionally, the call to the external function now uses the 'require' statement instead of the variable assignment.
