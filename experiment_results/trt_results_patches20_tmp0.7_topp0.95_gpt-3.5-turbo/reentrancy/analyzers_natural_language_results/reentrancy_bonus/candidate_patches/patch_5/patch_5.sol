// Changes Made:
// 1. Updated solidity version to 0.4.24
// 2. Moved the update of claimedBonus before the external call to withdrawReward to avoid reentrancy vulnerability
// 3. Changed the require statement in withdrawReward to check the result of the external call instead of the success variable.
