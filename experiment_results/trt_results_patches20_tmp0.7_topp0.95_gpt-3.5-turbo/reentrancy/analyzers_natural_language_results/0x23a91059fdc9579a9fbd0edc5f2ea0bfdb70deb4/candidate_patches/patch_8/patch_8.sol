// In the PrivateBank contract, the Deposit function was missing a require statement to check if the sent value is greater than or equal to the minimum deposit required. 
// The CashOut function was vulnerable to reentrancy attack as the external call was made before updating the balances. Therefore, it was updated by moving the external call 
// to the end of the function after updating the balances. In the Log contract, the LastMsg struct was moved inside the function AddMessage as the struct was not used 
// outside of the function.
