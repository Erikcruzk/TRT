// Changes Made:
// 1. Updated Solidity version to 0.8.0
// 2. Added a mapping to keep track of locked accounts during withdrawal to prevent reentrancy attacks
// 3. Changed require statements to include error messages for better readability
// 4. Reordered statements to prevent the possibility of a reentrancy attack
// 5. Used block.timestamp instead of now for better security and gas optimization
// 6. Used the new syntax for external calls
