// The following changes were made:
// 1. The constructor was added to the X_WALLET contract.
// 2. The keyword "memory" was added when creating a new struct in the Log contract.
// 3. The "payable" keyword was removed from the Collect function as it is unnecessary.
// 4. The "require" statement was added to ensure that the conditions for withdrawing funds are met before transferring the funds.
// 5. The "var" keyword was changed to "Holder storage" in the Put and Collect functions to specify the storage location of the Holder struct.
