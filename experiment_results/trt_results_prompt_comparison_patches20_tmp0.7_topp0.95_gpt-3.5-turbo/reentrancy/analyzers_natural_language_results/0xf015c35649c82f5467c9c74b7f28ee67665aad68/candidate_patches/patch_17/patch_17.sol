// The contract was repaired by following the best practices in Solidity. The constructor function was updated to the new syntax. 
// The var keyword was replaced with the appropriate type for the variables. 
// The function Collect was updated to avoid reentrancy vulnerability by using the transfer() function instead of the call.value() pattern. 
// A require statement was added to validate the conditions for the transaction. 
// The struct Message was updated to be a memory variable instead of a state variable.
