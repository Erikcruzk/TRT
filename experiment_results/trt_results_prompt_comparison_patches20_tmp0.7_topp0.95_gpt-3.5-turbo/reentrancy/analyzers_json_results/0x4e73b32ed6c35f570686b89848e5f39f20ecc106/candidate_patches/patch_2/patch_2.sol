/*
Changes Made:
1. Function names have been changed to follow Solidity naming conventions.
2. The "payable" modifier has been removed from the "collect" function as it is not necessary.
3. The "require" statement has been added to the "collect" function to check if the user's balance is greater than or equal to the minimum sum and the amount they want to collect.
4. The "require" statement has been added before the external call to prevent reentrancy attacks.
5. A memory variable has been added to the "addMessage" function to prevent overwriting of the message struct.
6. Variable and function names have been made consistent.
7. The "initialized" variable has been corrected to "initialized".
