// Changes made:
// 1. Function and variable names have been changed to follow Solidity naming conventions.
// 2. The 'initialized' variable was misspelled in the original contract, so it was corrected.
// 3. The 'SetMinSum' and 'SetLogFile' functions were changed to lowercase to follow Solidity naming conventions.
// 4. The 'Initialized' function was changed to lowercase to follow Solidity naming conventions.
// 5. The 'Collect' function was updated to prevent reentrancy attacks by first reducing the user's balance before calling the external function.
// 6. The 'require' statement was added to the 'collect' function to ensure that the user has enough balance before attempting to withdraw.
