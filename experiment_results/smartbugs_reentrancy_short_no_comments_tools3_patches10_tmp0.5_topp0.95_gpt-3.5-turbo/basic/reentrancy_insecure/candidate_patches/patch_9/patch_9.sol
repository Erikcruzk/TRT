// The repaired contract adds a new mapping 'locked' which prevents reentrancy attacks by blocking multiple calls to the 'withdrawBalance' function from the same address. It also adds additional require statements to check for sufficient balance and to ensure that the transfer was successful. The contract also uses the latest version of Solidity.
