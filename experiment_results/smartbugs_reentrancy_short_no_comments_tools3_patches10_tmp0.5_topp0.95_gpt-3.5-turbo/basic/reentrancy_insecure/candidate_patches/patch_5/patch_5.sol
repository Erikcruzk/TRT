// Changes Made
// 1. Updated the Solidity version to 0.8.0
// 2. Added a mapping to keep track of whether a withdrawal is already in progress for a user
// 3. Added a check to ensure that a withdrawal is not initiated while a previous withdrawal is still in progress
// 4. Added a check to ensure that the user has a balance to withdraw
// 5. Moved the update of userBalances[msg.sender] to after the withdrawal to prevent reentrancy attacks
// 6. Added a check to ensure that the withdrawal was successful before unlocking the user's account.
