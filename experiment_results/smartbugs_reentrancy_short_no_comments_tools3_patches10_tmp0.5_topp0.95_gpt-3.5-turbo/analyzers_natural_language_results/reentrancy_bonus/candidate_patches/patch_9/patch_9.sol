// Changes Made:
// 1. Removed the "INSECURE" comment and unnecessary mapping.
// 2. Updated the pragma version.
// 3. Added the "value" field to the recipient.call() function to prevent reentrancy.
// 4. Moved the claimedBonus[recipient] assignment before the withdrawReward() function to prevent reentrancy.
