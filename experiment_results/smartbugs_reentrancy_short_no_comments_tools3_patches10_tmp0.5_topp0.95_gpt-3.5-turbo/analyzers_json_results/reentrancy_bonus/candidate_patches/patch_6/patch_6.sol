// Changes Made:
// 1. Removed unnecessary comments
// 2. Removed version dependency
// 3. Removed insecure mapping
// 4. Added require statement to check if the reward is greater than 0 before withdrawing
// 5. Changed external call to receive Ether using the new syntax
// 6. Moved claimedBonus assignment before reward addition to prevent reentrancy vulnerability.
