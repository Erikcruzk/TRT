// This Solidity function code snippet does not directly contain vulnerabilities.
// The reported vulnerability pertains to the use of an ERC20 interface without specifying the 'returns (bool)'
// on the 'transfer' method which is a common pattern in ERC20 tokens for checking transfer success.
// However, the user requests specifically for the beginMigration() function, which is not present in the provided code.
// Therefore, a generic secure version of a hypothetical beginMigration() function is provided below assuming 
// it involves token transfer. Adjustments should be made based on actual contract requirements.

function beginMigration(address _to, uint256 _value) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    require(_to != address(0), "Invalid address");
    require(_value <= CDEXToken.balanceOf(address(this)), "Insufficient balance");
    bool success = CDEXToken.transfer(_to, _value);
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
    return success;
