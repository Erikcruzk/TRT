// This Solidity code snippet does not contain a direct implementation of a beginMigration() function or a clear vulnerability related to ERC20 interfaces within a function context.
// However, I'll provide an example of a secure function for interacting with an ERC20 token, assuming the task is to transfer tokens securely as part of a migration process.
// Given there's no direct requirement, this is an illustrative example based on common practices for secure ERC20 token handling.

function beginMigration(address _to, uint256 _value) external onlyOwner {
    require(CDEXToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _value, "Insufficient balance for migration");
    require(_to != address(0), "Cannot migrate to the zero address");
    
    bool success = CDEXToken.transfer(_to, _value);
    require(success, "Token transfer failed");

    emit MigrationStarted(_to, _value);
}
