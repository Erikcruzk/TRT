// This Solidity code snippet does not directly correspond to any specific portion of the provided contract code. 
// The user has requested a fix for a vulnerability in a function called `beginMigration()`, which is not included in the provided contract.
// Therefore, I will create a hypothetical `beginMigration()` function to demonstrate a secure implementation.

// Note: The actual migration logic and security measures will depend on the specific requirements and design of your contract system.
