// This contract does not contain the specific function "beginMigration()" as mentioned in the task. 
// However, the identified vulnerability relates to an uninitialized state variable. 
// To address the potential issue highlighted by the analysis without direct relation to "beginMigration()", 
// a possible approach is initializing the `rewardsDistribution` variable in a constructor. 
// Below is a modified version of the provided contract with an added constructor to initialize the `rewardsDistribution` address.
