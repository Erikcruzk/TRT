This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

slither Analysis Results
Vulnerability: uninitialized-state found in the following piece of code:

    address public rewardsDistribution;


The contract is among the source code below:



pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

contract RewardsDistributionRecipient {
    address public rewardsDistribution;

    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) external;

    modifier onlyRewardsDistribution() {
        require(msg.sender == rewardsDistribution, "Caller is not RewardsDistribution contract");
        _;
    }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
