// No specific function with the vulnerability mentioned. However, the issue lies in the contract's state variable initialization.
// To address the uninitialized state variable "rewardsDistribution", a constructor can be added for initialization:

pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

contract RewardsDistributionRecipient {
    address public rewardsDistribution;

    constructor(address _rewardsDistribution) public {
        rewardsDistribution = _rewardsDistribution;
    }

    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) external;

    modifier onlyRewardsDistribution() {
        require(msg.sender == rewardsDistribution, "Caller is not RewardsDistribution contract");
        _;
    }
}
