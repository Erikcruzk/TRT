// This is not a direct implementation of a function or contract with vulnerabilities as described by the user request. The provided information does not contain a specific Solidity function named `beginMigration()` that needs fixing or any specific vulnerability related to a function implementation. The concern raised was about the non-standard ERC20 interface `EIP20NonStandardInterface`, specifically about its `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods not returning a value, which deviates from the standard ERC-20 specification that expects these methods to return a boolean value indicating success or failure.

// A correct approach to adhering to the ERC-20 standard for these methods, assuming we are tasked with adjusting or suggesting changes for compliance, would be to modify the interface to include return values for both `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods, as shown below:

interface EIP20NonStandardInterface {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
    function transfer(address dst, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 amount);
}
