// This is not a direct fix because the described issue is a design choice rather than a coding error.
// However, changing the `transfer` and `transferFrom` function signatures to comply with ERC-20 standard would look like this:

function transfer(address dst, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
