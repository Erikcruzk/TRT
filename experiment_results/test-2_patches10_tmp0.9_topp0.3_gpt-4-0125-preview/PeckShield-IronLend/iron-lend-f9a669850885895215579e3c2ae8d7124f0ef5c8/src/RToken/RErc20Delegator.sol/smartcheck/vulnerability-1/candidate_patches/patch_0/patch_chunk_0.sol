// The RErc20Delegator contract does not contain a beginMigration() function directly.
// However, based on the context, here's an example fix for a hypothetical vulnerable beginMigration() function.

function beginMigration() external {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can start migration");
    // Additional logic for migration would go here
    // Ensure that the migration logic prevents locking of funds or other vulnerabilities
