// The provided code does not contain a definition for beginMigration(). As such, a generic improvement cannot be applied without knowing the specific context or functionality of the missing function. Below is a placeholder for the beginMigration() function, implementing basic access control to mitigate unauthorized access, which is a common vulnerability point. However, please adjust the logic according to your contract's specific needs.

function beginMigration() external {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only the admin can begin migration");
    // Migration logic here
}
