// This contract does not contain a function directly named beginMigration(), nor does it exhibit an explicit vulnerability named SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY in the provided code.
// It is not clear from the provided context which specific function may contain the vulnerability relating to locked funds.
// If you're concerned about locked funds due to the contract's inability to manage or extract funds (for example, from its payable fallback function or inability to withdraw tokens),
// you might be looking for functions related to administrative controls over funds or emergency mechanisms to recover funds.
// Given the lack of direct reference or existent function named beginMigration(), it's not possible to provide a corrected version of it.
// Please revise your request or specify the function you are concerned about for an accurate response.
