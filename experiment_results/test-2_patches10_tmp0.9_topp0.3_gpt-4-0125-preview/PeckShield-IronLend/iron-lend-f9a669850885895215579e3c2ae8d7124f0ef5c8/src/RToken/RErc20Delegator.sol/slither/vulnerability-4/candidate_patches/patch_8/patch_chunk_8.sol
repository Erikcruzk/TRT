// The provided code does not contain a definition for beginMigration(). 
// Therefore, a direct fix related to a function named beginMigration() cannot be given based on the provided code.
// However, if beginMigration() refers to a pattern of initializing or migrating contract states, 
// ensuring safety against re-entrancy can be achieved by using state checks or mutexes in such functions. 
// As an example of a preventive measure, here is a hypothetical implementation of a beginMigration() function with a re-entrancy guard:

function beginMigration() external {
    // Ensure this function can only be called by an authorized party
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can begin migration");
    
    // Ensure the contract is not already in a migration process to prevent re-entry attacks
    require(!_notEntered, "Reentrancy detected");

    _notEntered = false; // Lock the contract state to prevent re-entrancy

    // Custom logic for migration here
    // For example, updating contract state, moving funds, changing contract ownership/admin roles, etc.

    _notEntered = true; // Unlock the contract after operation is complete
}
