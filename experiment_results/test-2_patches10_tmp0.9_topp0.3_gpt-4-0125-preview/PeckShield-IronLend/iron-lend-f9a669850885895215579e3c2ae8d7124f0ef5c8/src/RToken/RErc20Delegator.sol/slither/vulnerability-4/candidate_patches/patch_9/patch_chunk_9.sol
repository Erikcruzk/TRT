// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or any clear vulnerability related directly to reentrancy in the shared contract segments. 
// As a program repair tool focusing on smart contract vulnerabilities, without a specific function to examine or repair instructions related to a reentrancy issue,
// here's a generic non-reentrant modifier that can be applied to functions to mitigate reentrant calls. This should be integrated where appropriate:

 * @title NonReentrant
 * @dev Helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.
 */
contract NonReentrant {
    // We use a single lock for the whole contract to prevent any reentry.
    bool private _notEntered;

    constructor() internal {
        // Stating that we have not entered the function.
        _notEntered = true;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Prevents a contract from calling itself, directly or indirectly.
     * Calling a `nonReentrant` function from another `nonReentrant`
     * function is not supported. It is possible to prevent this from happening
     * by making the `nonReentrant` function external, and make it call a
     * private function that does the actual work.
     */
    modifier nonReentrant() {
        // Ensure the function hasn't been entered yet.
        require(_notEntered, "Reentrant call detected");
        
        // Mark as entered.
        _notEntered = false;

        // Execute the function body.
        _;

        // Mark as not entered.
        _notEntered = true;

// Example of applying it to a function:
// function mySecureFunction() external nonReentrant {
//     // Function logic goes here
// }
