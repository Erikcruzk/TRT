// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any mention of a migration process.
// Based on the provided context and the request for a fixed version of beginMigration(), 
// there seems to be a misunderstanding or a mismatch in the provided details.

// If you're looking for a fix or enhancement related to the reported vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// the provided contract does not explicitly lock funds, but careful attention should be paid to the interaction
// with external contracts (IETHBondingCurve, IErc20BondingCurve) to ensure they do not inadvertently lock funds.

// Please provide additional context or correct the function name for further assistance.
