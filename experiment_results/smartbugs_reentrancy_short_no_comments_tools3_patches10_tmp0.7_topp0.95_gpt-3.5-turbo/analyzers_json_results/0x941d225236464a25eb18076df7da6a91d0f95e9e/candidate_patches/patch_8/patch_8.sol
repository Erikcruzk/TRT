// The repaired Smart Contract has the following changes:
// 1. The constructor function was renamed to match the contract name
// 2. The Log contract was instantiated using the "new" keyword
// 3. The "if" statements were replaced with "require" statements to ensure that the conditions are met
// 4. The transfer function was replaced with the transfer() function to prevent reentrancy issues
// 5. The fallback function was updated to be "external" and "payable" to receive ether transactions.
