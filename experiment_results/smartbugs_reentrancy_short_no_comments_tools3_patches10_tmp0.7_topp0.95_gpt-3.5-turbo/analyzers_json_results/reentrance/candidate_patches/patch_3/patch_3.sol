// This Solidity Smart Contract has been repaired to prevent the reentrancy and integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities found by the smart contract analyzers. The 'withdraw' function now uses a reentrancy guard by setting a 'locked' flag to prevent multiple calls. The 'withdraw' function now uses the 'transfer' method to send funds to the caller, which handles reentrancy issues. The integer overflow/underflow vulnerability has been fixed by using the 'require' function to validate the balance before withdrawing funds.
