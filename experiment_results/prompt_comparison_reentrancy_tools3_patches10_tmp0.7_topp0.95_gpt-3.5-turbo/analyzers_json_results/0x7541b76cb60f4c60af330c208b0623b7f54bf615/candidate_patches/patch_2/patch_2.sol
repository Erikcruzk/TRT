/**
 * Changes made:
 * - Moved struct Holder and mapping Acc above functions to avoid error while using mapping in functions.
 * - Added require statements in function collect to ensure that minimum balance is met, requested amount is less than or equal to balance and the unlock time has been reached.
 * - Replaced var with Holder in functions put and collect to explicitly define the type.
 * - Replaced LogFile.AddMessage with LogFile.addMessage to match the function name defined in contract Log.
 * - Removed the payable modifier from function collect as it was not required.
 * - Added a memory variable lastMsg in function addMessage to create a new message object each time the function is called.
 * - Changed the variable names to follow Solidity naming conventions (camelCase and starting with lowercase letter).
 * - Added appropriate comments to improve code readability.
