// The repaired contract now includes a lock mechanism to prevent reentrancy attacks. The withdraw function checks that the sender is not currently locked, transfers the requested amount to the sender, and then updates the sender's balance and unlocks them. This ensures that any external calls made during the transfer cannot re-enter the contract and manipulate the sender's balance.
