Vulnerability: reentrancy-benign found in the following piece of code:

```
    function lockTokens(

        uint256 _endDate,

        uint256 _amount,

        address _tokenAddress

    ) external nonReentrant {

        require(now < _endDate, "endDate should be bigger than now");

        require(_amount != 0, "amount cannot 0");

        require(

            _tokenAddress != address(0),

            "Token adress cannot be address(0)"

        );

        require(

            IERC20(_tokenAddress).transferFrom(

                msg.sender,

                address(this),

                _amount

            ),

            "Transaction failed"

        );

        require(poolCount == 0, "Pool count must be 0");

        pool = LockInfo(now, _endDate, _amount, _tokenAddress, msg.sender);

        poolCount = poolCount.safeAdd(1);

```

The contract is among the source code below:

```
}

contract Lock is ReentrancyGuard {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    struct LockInfo {
        uint256 startedDate;
        uint256 endDate;
        uint256 amount;
        address tokenAddress;
        address managerAddress;
    }

    uint256 public poolCount = 0;
    LockInfo public pool;

    modifier onlyManager() {
        require(msg.sender == pool.managerAddress);
        _;
    }

    function lockTokens(
        uint256 _endDate,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _tokenAddress
    ) external nonReentrant {
        require(now < _endDate, "endDate should be bigger than now");
        require(_amount != 0, "amount cannot 0");
        require(
            _tokenAddress != address(0),
            "Token adress cannot be address(0)"
        );
        require(
            IERC20(_tokenAddress).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                _amount
            ),
            "Transaction failed"
        );
        require(poolCount == 0, "Pool count must be 0");
        pool = LockInfo(now, _endDate, _amount, _tokenAddress, msg.sender);
        poolCount = poolCount.safeAdd(1);
    }

    function getPoolData()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint256,
            uint256,
            uint256,
            address,
            address
        )
    {
        return (
            pool.startedDate,
            pool.endDate,
            pool.amount,
            pool.tokenAddress,
            pool.managerAddress
        );
    }
```

Recommended fix: check-effects-interactions pattern

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
