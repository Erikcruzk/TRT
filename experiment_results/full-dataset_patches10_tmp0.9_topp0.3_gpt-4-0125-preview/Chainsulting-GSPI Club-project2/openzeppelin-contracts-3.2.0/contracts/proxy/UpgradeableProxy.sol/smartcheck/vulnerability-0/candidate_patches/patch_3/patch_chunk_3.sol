// There is no beginMigration() function in the provided code. The analysis and request seem to be a misunderstanding or misalignment with the provided smart contract code. Below is an example template of how a secure 'beginMigration' might look, assuming it's meant to upgrade the contract to a new implementation securely. This is not directly derived from the provided code but constructed based on standard practices for upgradeable contracts.

function beginMigration(address newImplementation) external onlyOwner {
    _upgradeTo(newImplementation);
}
