// There is no direct function named `beginMigration()` in the provided contract code. 
// However, based on the context and the requirement to return the compilable version 
// that fixes a potential vulnerability related to locked money in the `ProxyAdmin` contract, 
// a safe function that would allow the withdrawal of Ether from the contract can be added to mitigate such risks.
// Since the exact desired functionality is unclear without a specific `beginMigration()` context, 
// the following is a speculative addition to the `ProxyAdmin` contract to safely withdraw Ether:

function withdrawEther(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    recipient.transfer(amount);
}
