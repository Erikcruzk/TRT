// This specific request does not match any function directly in the provided code,
// and there is no direct mention of a function named `beginMigration()`.
// However, there is a function that might be related to migration or upgrade 
// of the relay hub address, which could potentially lock funds if misused. 

// To address the potential request, the closest function that might need 
// a fix regarding upgrade or migration in the context of GSNRecipient 
// (as the vulnerability hint provided doesn't match the exact request) is `_upgradeRelayHub`.
// Below is a safer version of what might be an "upgrade" or similar migration function:

function _upgradeRelayHub(address newRelayHub) internal virtual {
    address currentRelayHub = _relayHub;
    require(newRelayHub != address(0), "GSNRecipient: new RelayHub is the zero address");
    require(newRelayHub != currentRelayHub, "GSNRecipient: new RelayHub is the current one");
    
    // Ensuring that the contract can only upgrade to a new RelayHub that knows the contract 
    // is critical to prevent the contract from sending funds to a contract that doesn't know it
    // Thus, a check to ensure the new RelayHub recognizes this contract should be added here.
    // This is a hypothetical fix as the original context or method for recognition isn't provided in the base code.
    // An example check could be ensuring the new RelayHub returns a specific value or boolean
    // when a function like `isTrustedContract` is called with `address(this)`.
    // require(newRelayHub.isTrustedContract(address(this)), "GSNRecipient: new RelayHub does not recognize this contract.");

    emit RelayHubChanged(currentRelayHub, newRelayHub);

    _relayHub = newRelayHub;
