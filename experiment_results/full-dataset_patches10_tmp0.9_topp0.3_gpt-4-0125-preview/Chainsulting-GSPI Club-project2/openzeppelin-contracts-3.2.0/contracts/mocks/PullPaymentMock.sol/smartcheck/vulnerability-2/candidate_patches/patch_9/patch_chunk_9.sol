// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or its context, 
// and the described vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) doesn't directly relate to a specific 
// function within the given code. Therefore, there's no direct way to address a fix without 
// more context. Below is a general approach to mitigate locked funds in contracts, 
// which would usually involve implementing a withdraw function or similar to 
// allow the recovery of funds. Since the task specifies to only return the code 
// for beginMigration() and such a function isn't provided,
// here's an illustrative example function that could be related to migration 
// of funds within a contract to address potential locked funds issue:

function beginMigration(address payable _newContract) public onlyOwner {
    require(_newContract != address(0), "New contract address cannot be zero.");
    _newContract.transfer(address(this).balance);
}
