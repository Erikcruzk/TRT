// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), and no specific function has been directly pointed out as vulnerable based on the provided details.
// Reviewing the provided contract for general issues related to locked money (which the "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" warning might refer to), there's no direct function or contract mechanism provided to release funds or migrate them, which could result in locked funds if the contract does not have ways to transfer out its balance.
// Since the detailed vulnerability relates to potential locked funds without specifying a function, here's a hypothetical release mechanism that could be implemented to address such concerns:

function releaseFunds(address payable _to) public onlyOwner {
    require(address(this).balance > 0, "No funds to release");
    _to.transfer(address(this).balance);
}
