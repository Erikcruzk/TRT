// This contract does not contain a specific `beginMigration()` function as mentioned in the task. 
// However, the code provided does not directly show a function named `beginMigration()`. 
// Reviewing the given contract for the mentioned vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) and context does not directly 
// relate to any specific function with that exact name or a clear vulnerability associated with locked funds 
// since the provided contract mainly deals with GSN (Gas Station Network) recipient logic which is more about relaying calls.

// If `beginMigration()` is expected to relate to upgrading the RelayHub or similar operations 
// that could potentially lock funds if not handled correctly, no such explicit function is provided in the given code.

// Please ensure the function name is correct or provide additional details. 
// For preventive measures and handling potential locked funds in context similar to 
// upgrading relay hub or similar operations, please see the `_upgradeRelayHub` function below which is relevant to fund management and contract upgrades:

function _upgradeRelayHub(address newRelayHub) internal virtual {
    address currentRelayHub = _relayHub;
    require(newRelayHub != address(0), "GSNRecipient: new RelayHub is the zero address");
    require(newRelayHub != currentRelayHub, "GSNRecipient: new RelayHub is the current one");

    emit RelayHubChanged(currentRelayHub, newRelayHub);

    _relayHub = newRelayHub;
}

// This function ensures that the new relay hub address is not the zero address 
// and it's not the same as the current one before proceeding with the upgrade, 
// which prevents some forms of the funds being accidentally locked in the contract 
// due to an inappropriate upgrade. However, without a specific `beginMigration()` function, 
// this is the closest relevant code piece addressing potential upgrade and fund management concerns.
