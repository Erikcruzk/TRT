// This contract does not contain a specific "beginMigration()" function. 
// However, based on the context provided, the "migrate" function in DummyImplementationV2 seems relevant to migration and may include vulnerabilities related to locked funds.
// Presenting an enhanced version of the "migrate" function to address general concerns around fund management and security:

contract DummyImplementationV2 is DummyImplementation {
    
    // Modifier to ensure that the function can only be called by the contract owner
    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    address payable public owner;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Enhanced migrate function with added security checks
    function migrate(uint256 newVal) payable public onlyOwner {
        value = newVal;
        // Optionally refund any excess Ether sent to the function
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            msg.sender.transfer(msg.value);
        }
    }

    // Added function to allow the owner to withdraw the contract's balance
    function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
