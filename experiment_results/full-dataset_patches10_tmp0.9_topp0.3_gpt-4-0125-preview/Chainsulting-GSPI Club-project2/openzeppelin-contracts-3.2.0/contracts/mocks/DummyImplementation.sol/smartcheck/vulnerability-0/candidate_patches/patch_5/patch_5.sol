// There is no function named beginMigration() in the provided contract code. Therefore, no direct code fix can be applied based on the request.
// However, addressing the mentioned vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) would typically involve ensuring that funds sent to the smart contract can be withdrawn. Since no specific function for fund management or withdrawal is provided here, it's not possible to furnish a corrected version of a non-existent beginMigration() function or address the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue without further details on the intended functionality for handling ether.
