// The provided contract does not include a `beginMigration` function or any direct reference to locked funds 
// based on the provided analyzer results and code. However, given the context of needing a fix related to 
// potentially locked funds in an escrow contract, it's generally advisable to ensure that there are mechanisms 
// in place to prevent funds from being permanently locked, such as implementing a fail-safe or administrative controls. 

// Assuming the task might involve adding or modifying a function like `beginMigration` to mitigate the risk 
// of locked funds, a generic, secure example might look like this:

// Note: This is a hypothetical solution as the original contract does not have a `beginMigration` method.

function beginMigration(address payable newContract) public onlyOwner {
    require(newContract != address(0), "New address is the zero address");
    newContract.sendValue(address(this).balance);
