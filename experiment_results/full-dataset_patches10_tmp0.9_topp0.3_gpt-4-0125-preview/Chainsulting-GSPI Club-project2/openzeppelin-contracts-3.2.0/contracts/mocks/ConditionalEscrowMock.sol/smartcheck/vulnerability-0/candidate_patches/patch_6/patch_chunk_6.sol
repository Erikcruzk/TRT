// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or any direct mentions or implications of such a function. 
// However, based on the smart contract analyzer report on locked money (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY), it seems the concern might be about funds potentially getting locked in a contract without a way to recover them.
// Since the specific function to fix was requested but not found, here is a generic approach to ensure that a contract like Escrow can handle funds safely without locking them unintentionally.

// Note: This is a hypothetical fix, assuming `beginMigration()` would be a function in the context of managing or moving funds securely.

    // Function to safely begin migration of funds to a new contract

        require(_newContractAddress != address(0), "New contract address cannot be the zero address.");
