// The contract ERC20Mock does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(), and the provided code does not directly indicate a locked money vulnerability within a specific function. 
// However, locked money issues often relate to the handling of ether (or other tokens) without a clear way to withdraw them, or the absence of such functionality.
// Since the direct request was for the `beginMigration()` function which does not exist in the provided code, and addressing the locked money issue generally, below is an illustrative example of how one might implement a withdraw function to mitigate potential locked money issues:

function withdrawEther(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    recipient.transfer(amount);
}

// Note: This function assumes the presence of an `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict this action to authorized users, typically the contract owner. 
// Additionally, this is a generic solution and should be tailored to the specific requirements and security considerations of your contract.
