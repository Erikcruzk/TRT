// There are no explicit functions named `beginMigration()` in the provided code.
// However, if the concern is fixing a locked money vulnerability in the context where `beginMigration` might be a theoretical function to add for moving funds or state, here is an illustrative example of how such a function can be safely designed, considering the general context of `Initializable` contracts:

function beginMigration(address payable _newAddress) public onlyOwner {
    require(_newAddress != address(0), "New address cannot be the zero address.");
    _newAddress.transfer(address(this).balance);
}
