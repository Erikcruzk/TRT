// This code does not present a direct "Locked Money" vulnerability in its functions as they don't

// or contain selfdestruct/send/transfer calls that could lock funds. 
// However, to address concerns that might relate to initialization patterns potentially affecting 
// contract's ability to manage funds or its state securely, here's the improved version of beginMigration 
// function assuming it's part of the contract and aims to address general concerns of secure contract 
// upgradeability or state initialization.

// Note: The original prompt did not include a specific function named `beginMigration`,
// thus, providing a template for a secure, hypothetical beginMigration function 
// to demonstrate a safe approach to contract migration or upgrade patterns.
