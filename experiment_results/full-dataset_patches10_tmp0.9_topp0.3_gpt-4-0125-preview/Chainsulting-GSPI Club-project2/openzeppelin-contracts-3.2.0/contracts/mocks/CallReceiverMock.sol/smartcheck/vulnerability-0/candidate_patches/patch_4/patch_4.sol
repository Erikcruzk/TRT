pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any related functionality that directly corresponds to the vulnerability described (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY).
// However, based on the provided context and typical issues, there's no direct function named beginMigration or similar in the provided contract code.
// Therefore, it's not possible to provide a fixed version of a function that does not exist in the given code.
// If the task was to address the potential locking of funds in the contract without a way to withdraw them, then typically, a withdraw function would be added to address such concerns.
// Since the query asked specifically for the beginMigration function, which is not present, no further code adjustments can be provided based on the given instructions and contract code.
