// No code in the provided contract directly correlates with the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability 
// as mentioned by the user since the contract does not hold Ether in a way that it cannot be withdrawn. 
// All functions are either sending Ether or do not handle Ether at all. However, if there's a concern 
// about a function that could potentially lock funds due to its execution nature, it is not explicitly 
// provided in the above snippet. 

// For the context of addressing potential issues related to locked funds due to an infinite loop or 
// unbounded gas usage, the closest example in the provided code is the mockFunctionOutOfGas. 
// A solution to prevent such a scenario could include adding a limit to the loop to ensure termination.

// Updated function with a loop limit to avoid potential out-of-gas errors:

function mockFunctionOutOfGas() public payable {
    uint256 loopLimit = 1000; // Example limit to prevent infinite loop
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < loopLimit; ++i) {
        _array.push(i);
    }
}
