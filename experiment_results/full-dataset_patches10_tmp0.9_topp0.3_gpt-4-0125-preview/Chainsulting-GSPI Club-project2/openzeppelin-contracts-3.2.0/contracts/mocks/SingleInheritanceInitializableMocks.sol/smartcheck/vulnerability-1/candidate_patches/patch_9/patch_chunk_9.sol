// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(). However, the provided details 
// mention a vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) but do not specify a function directly associated with it.
// Based on the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or an incorrect reference, as the provided 
// contracts do not directly demonstrate a locked money issue through a specific function. 
// Yet, if the concern is about general contract upgradability and state migration handling funds safely, 
// ensuring that contracts can manage funds correctly during migrations would require functions that 
// manage balances explicitly, which are not present in the provided code.
