This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

Vulnerability: SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY found in the following piece of code:

contract MigratableMockV2 is MigratableMockV1 {


The contract is among the source code below:





pragma solidity >=0.4.24 <0.7.0;














abstract contract Initializable {

    


    bool private _initialized;

    


    bool private _initializing;

    


    modifier initializer() {
        require(_initializing || _isConstructor() || !_initialized, "Initializable: contract is already initialized");

        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;
        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            _initializing = true;
            _initialized = true;
        }

        _;

        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            _initializing = false;
        }
    }

    
    function _isConstructor() private view returns (bool) {
        
        
        
        
        
        address self = address(this);
        uint256 cs;
        
        assembly { cs := extcodesize(self) }
        return cs == 0;
    }
}





pragma solidity ^0.6.0;





contract MigratableMockV1 is Initializable {
  uint256 public x;

  function initialize(uint256 value) public payable initializer {
    x = value;
  }
}





contract MigratableMockV2 is MigratableMockV1 {
  bool internal _migratedV2;
  uint256 public y;

  function migrate(uint256 value, uint256 anotherValue) public payable {
    require(!_migratedV2);
    x = value;
    y = anotherValue;
    _migratedV2 = true;
  }
}





contract MigratableMockV3 is MigratableMockV2 {
  bool internal _migratedV3;

  function migrate() public payable {
    require(!_migratedV3);
    uint256 oldX = x;
    x = y;
    y = oldX;
    _migratedV3 = true;
  }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
