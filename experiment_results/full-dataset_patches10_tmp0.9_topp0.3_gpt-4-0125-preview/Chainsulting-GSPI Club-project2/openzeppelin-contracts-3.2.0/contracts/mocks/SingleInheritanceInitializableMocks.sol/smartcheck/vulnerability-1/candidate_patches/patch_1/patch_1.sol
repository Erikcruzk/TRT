// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function, and the provided details do not specify a vulnerability directly related to a function named beginMigration(). The vulnerability mentioned is SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY, but it does not correspond to a specific function in the provided contracts. The contracts provided do not directly demonstrate the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue without the context of a specific function causing it.

// Since the user asked for the beginMigration() function, which does not exist in the provided contracts, and there is a misunderstanding or miscommunication in the request, it's not possible to provide a corrected version of a function that does not exist based on the provided contracts and the information given.
