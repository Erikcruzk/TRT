// There are no funds getting locked in the MigratableMockV3 contract as per the given code.
// However, if you are looking for a general improvement to handle received funds or to ensure 
// there's an ability to withdraw funds if they ever get sent to this contract by mistake, 
// you might consider adding a withdraw function. But based on your request, here's the 
// original function without any specific vulnerability addressed related to locked funds, 
// as the contract itself does not directly deal with fund locking or similar mechanics:
