// This contract does not contain a specific function named `beginMigration()`.
// Since the request is to fix vulnerabilities related to locked money and no specific function is provided or mentioned to contain this issue,
// the following response provides an overview enhancement to ensure that funds can be retrieved from the contract, assuming that might be the concern:

contract MigratableMockV1 is Initializable {
  uint256 public x;
  address payable private owner;

  event FundsRecovered(uint256 amount, address to);

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function initialize(uint256 value) public payable initializer {
    x = value;
  }

  function recoverFunds() public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can recover funds");
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    owner.transfer(balance);
    emit FundsRecovered(balance, owner);
  }

  // If there are specific operations or functions such as migration
  // checks or transitions requiring attention, please provide those details.
