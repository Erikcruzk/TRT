// There's no explicit function named beginMigration() in the provided code. 
// Based on the context, it seems the focus might be on the migrate() functions 
// and the potential issue related to locking up funds or incorrect initialization.
// However, to address the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability which is typically about 
// providing a way to withdraw funds or preventing funds from being locked unintentionally, 
// and considering there's no direct 'beginMigration()' function or explicit details on 
// where funds might get locked, here's a generic solution that could apply:

// Adding a withdraw function to allow withdrawal of contract funds, 
// which could help mitigate the risk of locked funds.
// Note: This is a generic mitigation approach without explicit function 'beginMigration()' provided.
