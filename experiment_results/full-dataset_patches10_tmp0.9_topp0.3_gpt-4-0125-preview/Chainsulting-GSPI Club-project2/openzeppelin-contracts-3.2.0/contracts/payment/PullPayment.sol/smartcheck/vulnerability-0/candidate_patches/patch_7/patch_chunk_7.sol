// This contract does not contain a function explicitly named beginMigration(), and the provided analysis and code do not directly point out a specific vulnerable function related to locked funds. The provided smart contract analysis result mentions a general vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) but does not specify a function. Based on the context, it seems the concern might be about the overall pattern of handling funds, especially in Escrow or PullPayment contracts, but without a specific function like beginMigration() to address, an accurate fix cannot be provided based solely on the given instructions.

// If the concern is about locked funds in the context of these contracts, ensure safe withdrawal patterns and checks for contract balance are implemented. Always validate contracts for common pitfalls related to sending and receiving Ether to prevent unintended locking of funds.
