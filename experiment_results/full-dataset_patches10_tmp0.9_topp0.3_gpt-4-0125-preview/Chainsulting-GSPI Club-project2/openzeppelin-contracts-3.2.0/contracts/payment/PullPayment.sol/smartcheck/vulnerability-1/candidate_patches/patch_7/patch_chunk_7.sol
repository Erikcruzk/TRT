// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function, or any direct reference to locked money issues related to it.
// Given the context, it's possible you are asking for a mitigation to the generic issue of locked funds in a contract,

// However, without a specific function to correct, the best I can provide is a hypothetical function that could help mitigate locked funds in a contract like PullPayment.

// Hypothetical beginMigration function to safely transfer contract balance to a new contract or owner address.
