// The provided code does not contain a `beginMigration` function or a direct indication of locked funds vulnerability tied to a specific method. 
// Since the request is for fixing a vulnerability in `beginMigration`, but such a function is not present in the provided code,
// here's a general best practice template for a migration function in Solidity contracts, ensuring funds are not unintentionally locked.

function beginMigration(address newContract) public onlyOwner {
    require(newContract != address(0), "New contract address cannot be zero.");
    // Assuming there's a balance that needs to be migrated to the new contract.
    // Ensure the new contract has a function to receive and manage the migrated funds or state.
    
    uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
    if (contractBalance > 0) {
        (bool sent, ) = newContract.call{value: contractBalance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
    
    // Additional logic to handle migration of other state variables, if necessary.

    // Emit an event, if needed, to signal that the migration has begun or completed.
