// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit functionality that 
// could be directly associated with the vulnerability description provided. 
// Please ensure the correct code or function details are provided for a specific fix. 
// If you're asking for a general improvement regarding locked funds in a contract, ensure safe mechanisms 
// for fund management are included, like enabling withdrawals or rescue options for funds.

// Since the beginMigration() function is not provided and based on the description, 
// here's an example of a safe withdrawal pattern that could be applied in contexts where 
// fund locking might be a concern. This is not directly a fix but an illustrative approach 
// for safer fund handling:

function safeWithdrawal(address payable recipient) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
    require(amount > 0, "No funds available");
    (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed.");
}

// Remember to verify the original context or provide the specific details of the 
// beginMigration() function or other related functions for a precise solution.
