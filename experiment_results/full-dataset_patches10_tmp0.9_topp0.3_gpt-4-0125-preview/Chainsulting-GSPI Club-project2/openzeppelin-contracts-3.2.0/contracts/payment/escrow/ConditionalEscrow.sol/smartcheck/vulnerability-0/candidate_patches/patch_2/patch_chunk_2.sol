// There's no beginMigration() function in the provided contract code.
// However, to address the potential SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue, it's essential to ensure that funds can always be withdrawn or moved out of the contract. 
// Since the provided contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any detailed context about the migration process, 
// a generic solution to prevent locked funds is to implement a fail-safe mechanism that allows the contract owner to withdraw all the contract's balance. 
// This is a hypothetical solution based on the provided information:

function withdrawAll() public onlyOwner {
    address payable _owner = payable(owner()); // Ensure the owner's address is payable
    _owner.transfer(address(this).balance); // Transfer all contract balance to the owner
}
