// This Solidity snippet does not directly include a function named `beginMigration`. 
// However, to address the issue related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY, 
// typically functions to withdraw or rescue funds would be implemented. 
// Since no specific function `beginMigration()` exists or is mentioned in the provided code,
// and the vulnerability highlighted is about locked funds in a proxy contract, 
// below is an illustrative example of how one might implement a function to
// allow the recovery of funds mistakenly sent to the contract.

// NOTE: This is a conceptual illustration. Actual implementation may vary based on the contract's requirements.

function rescueLockedFunds(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) external ifAdmin {
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    recipient.transfer(amount);
}
