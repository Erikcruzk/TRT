// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any specific vulnerability fixable
// through modifying a single function. The mentioned SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability
// pertains to the potential for funds to be locked in the contract inadvertently without a
// withdrawal mechanism. However, without a specific function like `beginMigration()` to correct,
// and given the request to only provide Solidity code without explanations, there's no actionable
// code snippet to provide based on the provided contract code and instructions.
