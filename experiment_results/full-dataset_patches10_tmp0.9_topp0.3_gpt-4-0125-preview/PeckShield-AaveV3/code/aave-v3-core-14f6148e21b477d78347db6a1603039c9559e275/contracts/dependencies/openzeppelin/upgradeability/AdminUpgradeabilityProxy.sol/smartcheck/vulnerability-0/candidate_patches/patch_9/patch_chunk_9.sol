// The provided contract source does not contain a function explicitly named `beginMigration`. Given the context, it appears there might be some confusion or a mistake in the request. 
// However, considering the analysis and the possible interaction with vulnerabilities and the upgrade mechanism, below is a generic function that would typically be found in such contracts to start a migration or upgrade process.

// Note: This function is crafted based on typical patterns found in upgradeable smart contracts. Since the original prompt does not specify `beginMigration`, the following is an illustrative example based on standard practices:

pragma solidity 0.8.7;

contract AdminUpgradeabilityProxy is BaseAdminUpgradeabilityProxy, UpgradeabilityProxy {

    // This function would ideally be protected by appropriate access control mechanisms
    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) external ifAdmin {
        // Ensuring that the new implementation address is a contract and not a regular address
        require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), "New implementation must be a contract");

        // Updating the implementation to the new contract
        _upgradeTo(newImplementation);

        // Emitting an upgrade event (optional, but good practice)
        emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
    }
}
