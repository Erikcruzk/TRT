// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerable function based on the given context.
// However, to address the potential concern of locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) 
// and assuming the intention is to safely upgrade or manage funds, 
// you might consider implementing a withdraw function in a relevant contract that handles funds, 
// to mitigate the risk of funds being permanently locked in the contract. 
// Below is an example function that could be added to a contract managing funds, 
// to allow the withdrawal of Ether stored in the contract:

function withdraw(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient funds in the contract");
    (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Failed to send Ether");
}
