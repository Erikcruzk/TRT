// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration().
// However, to address the general concern of locked funds in a proxy contract,
// ensuring that the contract can receive and send Ether is important.
// Below is an illustrative example of how a proxy can be equipped to forward received Ether:

pragma solidity 0.8.7;

contract InitializableUpgradeabilityProxy is BaseUpgradeabilityProxy {
    // Existing code remains unchanged

    // Constructor to allow contract to receive Ether upon deployment, if necessary
    constructor() payable {}

    // Function to allow the contract to receive Ether with a simple fallback or receive function
    receive() external payable {}

    // Example function to safely forward Ether to another address, if needed
    function forwardEther(address payable recipient) external {
        Address.sendValue(recipient, address(this).balance);
    }
}
