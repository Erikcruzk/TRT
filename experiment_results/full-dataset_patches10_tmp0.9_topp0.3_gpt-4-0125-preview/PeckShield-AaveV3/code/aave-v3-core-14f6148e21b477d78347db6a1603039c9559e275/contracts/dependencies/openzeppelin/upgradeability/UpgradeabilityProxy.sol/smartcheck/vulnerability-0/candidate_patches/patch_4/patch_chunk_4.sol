// This contract does not contain a function called beginMigration(), 
// and based on the provided vulnerability report, there is no direct mention 
// of a specific vulnerable function to fix in relation to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY. 
// However, since the UpgradeabilityProxy contract could potentially lock money 
// without a way to retrieve it, I'm providing a hypothetical remedy by adding 
// a withdraw function to safely withdraw funds. This is not a direct fix 
// to a named vulnerability but a proactive measure to prevent funds from being locked.
