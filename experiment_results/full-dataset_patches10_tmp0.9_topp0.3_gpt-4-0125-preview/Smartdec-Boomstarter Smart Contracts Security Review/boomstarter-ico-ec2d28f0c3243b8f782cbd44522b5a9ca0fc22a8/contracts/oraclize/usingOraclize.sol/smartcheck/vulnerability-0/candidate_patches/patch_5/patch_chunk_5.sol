// There's no function named `beginMigration()` provided in the initial user input, therefore, I cannot directly supply a fixed version of it. Given the nature of the request, no specific code manipulation can be performed without a clear target function or logic to adjust. If you have a specific function such as `beginMigration()` you need assistance with, please provide its initial implementation for further guidance.
