// There is no function beginMigration() provided in the given contract code. Consequently, here is a generic template for a secure function based on typical migration patterns in Solidity. This template should be adjusted to fit the specific requirements and context of your contract.

function beginMigration(address newContractAddress) external onlyOwner {
    require(newContractAddress != address(0), "New contract address cannot be zero.");
    // Additional checks and logic for migration
    // For example, transferring assets or updating state variables to point to the new contract
    
    emit MigrationStarted(newContractAddress);
