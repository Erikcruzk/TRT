// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any other function that directly indicates vulnerable behavior based on the provided code and the mentioned vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY).
// Therefore, a direct fix related to a specific "beginMigration()" function cannot be provided without more context or the function's implementation details.
// It's recommended to review the contract for functions that may lock funds unintentionally and ensure that there are mechanisms to withdraw or transfer funds appropriately.
