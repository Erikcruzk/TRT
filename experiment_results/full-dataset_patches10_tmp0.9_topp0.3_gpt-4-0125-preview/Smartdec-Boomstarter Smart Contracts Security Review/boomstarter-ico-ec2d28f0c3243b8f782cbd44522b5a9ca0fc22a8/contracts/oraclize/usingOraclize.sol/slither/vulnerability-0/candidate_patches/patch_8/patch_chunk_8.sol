// The provided Solidity code does not contain a function named `beginMigration()`. 
// Since the task describes fixing a function called `beginMigration()`, but this function is not present in the supplied contract code, it's not possible to directly fulfill the request.
// Here is a generic placeholder for `beginMigration()` to be added to the contract, assuming it would relate to beginning a migration process. 
// Note: You'll need to integrate and adapt this based on your actual contract's requirements.

function beginMigration() external {
    // Placeholder for migration logic
    // Ensure to adapt this function based on your contract's actual migration needs
