// The provided code snippet does not include a beginMigration() function. 
// However, addressing the indicated concern about locked funds, here is a hypothetical solution
// for a function named beginMigration() that could be vulnerable to the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue.

// Note: This is a constructed example for educational purposes.

function beginMigration(address newAddress) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can migrate");
    require(newAddress != address(0), "Invalid address");

    // Assuming the contract holds some funds that need to be migrated
    uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
    require(contractBalance > 0, "No funds to migrate");

    (bool sent, ) = newAddress.call.value(contractBalance)("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
}
