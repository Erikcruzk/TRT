// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerabilities directly related to locking of funds as described. 
// However, based on the provided analysis and considering general contract safety, here's an illustrative approach to safely handle Ether transactions
// in a contract, which could be relevant to the concern of locked funds. Please adapt this to your specific needs.

// Note: This is an illustrative example and not a direct fix based on the provided contracts as they do not contain a function called beginMigration().

// Adding a withdraw function to mitigate the possibility of locked funds in the contract
function withdraw() public {
    // Implementation details would depend on the contract's design
    // Only authorized addresses should be able to withdraw funds
    // Example:
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
    msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
