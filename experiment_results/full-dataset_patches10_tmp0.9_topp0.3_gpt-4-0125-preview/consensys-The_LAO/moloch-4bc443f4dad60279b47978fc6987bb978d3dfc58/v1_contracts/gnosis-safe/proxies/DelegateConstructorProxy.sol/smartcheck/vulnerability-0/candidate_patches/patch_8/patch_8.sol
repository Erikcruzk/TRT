// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerabilities related to locked funds.
// However, given the task's directive and the provided context, there's no specific function named `beginMigration()` to fix.
// For clarity, the provided contracts do not explicitly lock funds but delegate call operations could potentially interact with malicious contracts.
// Since there's no direct request for code modification outside of a specified function that doesn't exist in the given context,
// it's not possible to provide a fixed version of `beginMigration()` as it's not part of the provided code.
