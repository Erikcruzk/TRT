// The vulnerability addressed is the shadowing of state variables by local variables.
// However, there's no function named beginMigration() provided in the given code.
// Additionally, the provided description mentions an issue with "shadowing-local" which is not directly linked to a specific function called beginMigration().
// Given this context, there appears to be a misunderstanding or misalignment with the request.
// If beginMigration() is intended to be added or modified, no specific details or existing code for this function were provided.
// For compliance, the function below is a placeholder and should be adapted based on the actual requirements of beginMigration() if it were to exist.
