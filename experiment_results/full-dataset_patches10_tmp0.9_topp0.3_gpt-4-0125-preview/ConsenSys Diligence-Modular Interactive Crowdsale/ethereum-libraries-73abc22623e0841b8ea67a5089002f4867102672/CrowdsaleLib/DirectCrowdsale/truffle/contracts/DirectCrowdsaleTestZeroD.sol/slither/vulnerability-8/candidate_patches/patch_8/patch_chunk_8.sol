// The provided code does not include a function specifically named `beginMigration()`, nor does it detail its functionality or its location within the contract structure. Thus, it's not possible to supply the corrected version of a function not explicitly given or described in the provided source code. Since the task is to return the code of the function `beginMigration()` to address a vulnerability, but such a function is not present in the provided source, there is no direct way to fulfill this request accurately.

// If `beginMigration()` is intended to be a new function or if there's been a misunderstanding about the function's name or its purpose related to the provided contracts, please provide the correct name or additional context. For now, no action can be taken based on the current instruction.
