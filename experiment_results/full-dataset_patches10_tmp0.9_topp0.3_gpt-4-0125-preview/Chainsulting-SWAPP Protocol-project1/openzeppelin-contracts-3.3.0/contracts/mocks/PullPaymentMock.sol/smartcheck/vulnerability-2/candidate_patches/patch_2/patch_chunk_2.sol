// The PullPaymentMock contract provided does not contain a beginMigration() function,
// and no explicit vulnerability related to locked funds in the provided code.
// However, addressing the general concern of locked funds in a contract extending PullPayment,
// one would ensure mechanisms to withdraw or migrate funds securely if such functionality is desired.
// Below is an illustrative example of how one might attempt to add a secure migration function
// to a contract like PullPaymentMock to address concerns of locked funds,
// though it's important to customize it per specific contract needs and security review.

// Note: This is a conceptual example; actual implementation will depend on contract specifics.
