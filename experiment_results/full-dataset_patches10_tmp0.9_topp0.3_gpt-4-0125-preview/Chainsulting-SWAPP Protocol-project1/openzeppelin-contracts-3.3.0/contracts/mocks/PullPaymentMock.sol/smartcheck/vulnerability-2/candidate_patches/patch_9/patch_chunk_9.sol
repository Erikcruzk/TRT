// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or any direct mention of a function or vulnerability tied to locked funds directly in its implementation. Given the context, however, I'll provide a general approach to safely handle fund transfers in Solidity, which can mitigate risks related to locked funds in smart contracts, especially in functions handling payments or migrations.

// This is a mockup function based on the request and the context of handling funds securely:

pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.8.0;

contract PullPaymentMock is PullPayment {
    // Assuming there needs to be a migration function that might be vulnerable to locked funds
    // Note: This is a hypothetical implementation as the original code doesn't provide a beginMigration function or similar.
    event MigrationInitiated(address indexed owner);
    event MigrationCompleted(address indexed owner, uint256 amountTransferred);

    address private migrationDestinationAddress;
    bool private migrationInitiated = false;

    constructor() public payable {}

    // Function to begin migration of funds to a new contract/address
    // Ensures only the owner can initiate the migration and that the contract has not already begun a migration.
    function beginMigration(address _newAddress) public onlyOwner {
        require(!migrationInitiated, "Migration has already been initiated.");
        require(_newAddress != address(0), "New address cannot be the zero address.");
        require(_newAddress != address(this), "New address cannot be the same as the current address.");
        
        migrationInitiated = true;
        migrationDestinationAddress = _newAddress;
        
        emit MigrationInitiated(msg.sender);
    }

    // Function to complete the migration, transferring all funds to the new address
    // Can be called by anyone to ensure funds can be moved even if the original owner is not available to complete the migration.
    function completeMigration() public {
        require(migrationInitiated, "Migration has not been initiated.");
        require(address(this).balance > 0, "No funds available for migration.");
        
        uint256 balanceToTransfer = address(this).balance;
        (bool sent, ) = migrationDestinationAddress.call{value: balanceToTransfer}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        emit MigrationCompleted(migrationDestinationAddress, balanceToTransfer);
        
        // Reset migration state
        migrationInitiated = false;
    }
