// There is no specific function named beginMigration() in the provided code.
// Given the context and the nature of the vulnerability, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a typo.
// However, to address the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue, contracts should have a way to withdraw or transfer Ether to prevent it from being locked.
// Since there is no explicit function with issues provided, I'll propose a generic solution that could be applied to improve contract safety regarding Ether management.

// Assuming a withdrawal function might mitigate the mentioned issue, here is a simple withdrawal pattern:

function withdraw() public {
    // Implementation to withdraw or transfer Ether.
