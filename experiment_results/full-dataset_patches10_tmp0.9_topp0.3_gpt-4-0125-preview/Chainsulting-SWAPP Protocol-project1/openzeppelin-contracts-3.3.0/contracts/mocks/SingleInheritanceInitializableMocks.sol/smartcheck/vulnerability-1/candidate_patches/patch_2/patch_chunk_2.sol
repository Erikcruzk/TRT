// This code does not contain a function explicitly named `beginMigration`, nor does it highlight a direct vulnerability within a specific function based on the provided information.
// However, considering the context and the nature of smart contract migrations, a common issue such as "locked money" can occur if a contract does not correctly handle its balance or
// does not provide a mechanism to transfer its balance when migrating to a new contract.
// As there's no exact match for `beginMigration`, the closest contextually relevant function provided is `migrate` in `MigratableMockV2`.
// Assuming the task is to address potential locked money issues within this migration context, the following is an enhancement of the `migrate` function to include a balance transfer mechanism.

// Note: This is an assumption based on the provided context. The original request does not match any function or exact vulnerability description provided.

contract MigratableMockV2 is MigratableMockV1 {
    bool internal _migratedV2;

    function migrate(uint256 value, uint256 anotherValue, address payable _newContractAddress) public payable {
