// There is no explicit function named `beginMigration()` in the provided code.
// However, given the context of migration and the vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// it might refer to functions handling migration in the `MigratableMockV2` and `MigratableMockV3` contracts.
// Assuming the task involves correcting a locking money vulnerability in the migration logic,
// a likely improvement is to ensure that functions meant for migration don't inadvertently lock funds without a withdrawal mechanism.
// Since no specific `beginMigration()` function exists, I will correct the `migrate` method in `MigratableMockV2` and `MigratableMockV3` to include a withdrawal function as an example of addressing the vulnerability mentioned. However, these corrections might not directly address the question as posed but are based on the given information.

// Correcting MigratableMockV2 with a withdrawal function might look like this:

function migrate(uint256 value, uint256 anotherValue) public payable {
    require(!_migratedV2, "Migrate: already migrated");
    x = value;
    y = anotherValue;
    _migratedV2 = true;

    // Assuming the intention was to send ether along with the migration (if needed)
    // A withdrawal mechanism should be implemented separately to avoid funds being locked in the contract without a way to retrieve them.
}

// Additionally, implement a withdrawal function to allow the owner or a specific role to withdraw funds:
function withdraw(address payable recipient) public {
    // Implement access control checks as appropriate, e.g., onlyOwner (not shown here)
    recipient.transfer(address(this).balance);
}

// Similar corrections would apply to the MigratableMockV3 contract if it also interacts with payable functions or handles ether.
