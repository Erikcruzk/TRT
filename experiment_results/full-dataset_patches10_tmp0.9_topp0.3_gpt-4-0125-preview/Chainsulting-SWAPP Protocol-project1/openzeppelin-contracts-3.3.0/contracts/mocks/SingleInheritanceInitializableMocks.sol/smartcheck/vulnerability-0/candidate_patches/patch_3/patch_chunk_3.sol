// There is no explicit function named "beginMigration()" in the provided code. 
// However, given the context and task description, the closest relevant functions are the "migrate" functions.
// Below is an improved version of the migrate function from MigratableMockV3 addressing potential issues:

contract MigratableMockV3 is MigratableMockV2 {
  bool internal _migratedV3;
  
  function migrate() public payable {
    require(!_migratedV3, "Already migrated.");
    require(msg.value == 0, "This operation cannot accept ETH.");
    uint256 oldValueX = x;
    x = y;
    y = oldValueX;
    _migratedV3 = true;
  }
