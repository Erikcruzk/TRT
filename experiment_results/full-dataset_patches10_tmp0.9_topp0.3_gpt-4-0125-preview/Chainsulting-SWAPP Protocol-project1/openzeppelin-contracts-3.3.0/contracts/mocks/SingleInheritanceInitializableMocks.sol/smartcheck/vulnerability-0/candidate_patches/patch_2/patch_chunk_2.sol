// No relevant function named beginMigration() is directly provided in the given code.
// Assuming the request aimed for the "migrate" functions viewed as potential migration mechanisms,
// and considering the identified vulnerability was labeled under "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY",
// a safe withdraw function is necessary to resolve the locked money vulnerability.
// Since no specific function named beginMigration() exists and considering the vulnerability, an illustrative example of a fix:

contract MigratableMockWithWithdraw is MigratableMockV3 {
    address payable private owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = payable(msg.sender); // Initializing the owner to the address deploying the contract
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
