// There isn't a direct function named beginMigration() in the provided code, but based on the context of the task and the analysis results, 
// there is no specific function with a vulnerability directly mentioned. However, the description of vulnerabilities like SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY 
// typically relates to the absence of a way to withdraw or migrate funds in contracts. Given this, and based on the code structure provided,
// it seems like the migrate function across various versions of MigratableMock contracts is related to migrating state and possibly funds.
// Since there's no explicit function named beginMigration(), and to address potential issues related to locked funds in a migration process,
// a generic solution would involve ensuring there's a secure way to withdraw or move funds during migration. This involves adding a withdrawal 
// function to allow the owner or authorized accounts to transfer out funds. However, without explicit instructions on how funds are handled, 
// the suggested solution focuses on the pattern of migration and ensuring a safer migration process without directly handling funds:

// Adding a generic withdrawal function to address potential locked money issue - assuming this is what you're looking for.
// Note: Adjust the ownership and security checks as per your contract's design.
