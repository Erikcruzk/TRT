// There is no beginMigration() function in the given contracts. 
// Based on the context and the detected vulnerability "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY", 
// the closest match seems to be the migrate() functions that do not handle funds securely. 
// However, without a specific beginMigration() function and further instructions, 
// here's a general improvement for handling funds in such contracts, assuming a migration function could look like this:

function beginMigration() public payable {
    // Correct handling of funds or state changes should be implemented here.
}
