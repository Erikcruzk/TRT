// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function nor a direct vulnerability related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY.
// However, based on the provided context, there's a misinterpretation as no specific "beginMigration" function is present,
// and the provided contracts do not directly demonstrate the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue.
// Thus, there's nothing to fix based on the exact request and provided details.
