// The contract or specific function that you asked to repair or provide does not match the user scenario described. There was no mention or request for a function named "beginMigration()" within the provided context. The given context only discussed a potential vulnerability within the "EtherReceiverMock" contract, specifically in its receive function. Therefore, based on your instructions, I am unable to provide a "beginMigration()" function as it was not part of the provided details or request for repair.

// If you have additional code or different requirements, please provide them, and I'll be glad to assist.
