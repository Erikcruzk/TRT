This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

slither Analysis Results
Vulnerability: locked-ether found in the following piece of code:

    receive () external payable {

        if (!_acceptEther) {

            revert();

        }


The contract is among the source code below:





pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.8.0;

contract EtherReceiverMock {
    bool private _acceptEther;

    function setAcceptEther(bool acceptEther) public {
        _acceptEther = acceptEther;
    }

    receive () external payable {
        if (!_acceptEther) {
            revert();
        }
    }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
