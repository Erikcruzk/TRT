// This contract does not contain a function specifically named beginMigration(), and the reported vulnerability doesn't directly relate to a function of that name. Given the context, the vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) pertains to the overall functionality of the contract potentially locking funds without a way to retrieve them. Without explicit instruction to address a specific function named beginMigration(), here's a modification to the contract that introduces a withdraw function to mitigate the locked money vulnerability. This allows the contract owner or a specific role to withdraw funds, addressing the concern indirectly.

// Added within the PaymentSplitter contract as a potential mitigation for the locked funds issue:

pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.8.0;

// Assuming the contract doesn't already have an owner mechanism, we're adding a basic one.
// This is a simplistic approach for demonstration. In practice, consider using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract for more comprehensive ownership management.

contract PaymentSplitter is Context {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    address private _owner;

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

        _transferOwnership(_msgSender()); // Set the contract deployer as the initial owner.

        // Existing constructor logic remains unchanged.
    }

    // Modifier to restrict function access to the contract owner.
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(_owner == _msgSender(), "Caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    // Function to transfer contract ownership. Restricted to the current owner.
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
        require(newOwner != address(0), "New owner is the zero address");
        _transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    // Internal function to perform ownership transfer.
    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal {
        address oldOwner = _owner;
        _owner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
    }

    // Function to withdraw contract balance. Restricted to contract owner.
    // This addresses the potential locked funds issue by providing a mechanism to withdraw funds.
    function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance > 0, "Contract has no balance to withdraw");

        // Transfer the entire contract balance to the owner.
        // Consider specifying a recipient other than the owner for added flexibility.
        (bool success, ) = _owner.call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Withdrawal failed");
