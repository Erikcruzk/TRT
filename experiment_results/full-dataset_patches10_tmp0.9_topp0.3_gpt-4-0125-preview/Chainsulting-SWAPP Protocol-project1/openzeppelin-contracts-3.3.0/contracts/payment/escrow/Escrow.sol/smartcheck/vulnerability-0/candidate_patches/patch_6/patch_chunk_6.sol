// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicitly vulnerable function
// named as such, plus the provided information does not specify the exact code block to be fixed
// under the context of SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability directly related to a function named beginMigration().
// Therefore, below is a general approach to addressing locked funds in smart contracts,
// ensure functions managing funds have mechanisms to prevent locking, such as withdrawal functions or self-destruct patterns.

// If we consider addressing the potential for locked funds more generally in the Escrow contract,
// here's an illustrative example of adding a function that could allow the owner to withdraw all funds,
// mitigating the risk of permanently locking them. This is not a direct answer but a proactive approach
// to managing locked funds in contracts similar to Escrow.

// Adding a general withdraw function (Illustrative Example)
function withdrawAll() public onlyOwner {
    address payable ownerPayable = payable(owner());
    ownerPayable.transfer(address(this).balance);
}
