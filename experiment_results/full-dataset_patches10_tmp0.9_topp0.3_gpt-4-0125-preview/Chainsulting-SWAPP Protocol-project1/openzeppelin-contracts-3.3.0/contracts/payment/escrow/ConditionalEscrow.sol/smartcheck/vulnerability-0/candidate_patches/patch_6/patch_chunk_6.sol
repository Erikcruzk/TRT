// The provided contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerability associated with locked funds as per the smartcheck analysis results shared. 
// Since locked funds often relate to the inability to withdraw or move funds after being deposited or due to the contract's logic, 
// itâ€™s crucial to ensure all functions dealing with funds management are secure and allow for intended operations.

// Since the beginMigration() function is not provided or mentioned explicitly, 
// and based on the general context of locked funds vulnerability, 
// I can show an example of how a safe migration function might be implemented in a similar contract to prevent locked funds. 
// This example assumes a migration scenario where funds need to be moved securely to a new contract.

// Example of a safe fund migration function implementation

function beginMigration(address payable newContract) public onlyOwner {
    require(newContract != address(0), "New contract address cannot be zero.");
    require(Address.isContract(newContract), "New address must be a contract.");

    uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
    require(contractBalance > 0, "No funds to migrate.");

    (bool success, ) = newContract.call{value: contractBalance}("");
    require(success, "Migration failed.");

    emit MigrationStarted(address(this), newContract, contractBalance);
}

// Note: This is a hypothetical function and should be adjusted according to the specific requirements and context of your contract.
// The actual implementation details would depend on the new contract's interface and how it's supposed to handle incoming funds.
