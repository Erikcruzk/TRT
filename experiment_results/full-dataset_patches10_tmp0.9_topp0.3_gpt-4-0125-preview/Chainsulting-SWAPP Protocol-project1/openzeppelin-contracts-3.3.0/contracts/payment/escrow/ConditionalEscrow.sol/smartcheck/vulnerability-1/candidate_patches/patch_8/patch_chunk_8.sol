// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration() or any explicit vulnerabilities directly related to the provided smartcheck analysis result: SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY. 
// The issue highlighted pertains to the abstract nature of ConditionalEscrow potentially locking funds if not properly implemented.
// However, if a migration mechanism is needed, and assuming it's related to moving funds securely from one contract to another, a generic secure function might look like this:

// Note: The following code is a hypothetical example since the original request does not match the provided codebase.

function beginMigration(address newContract) public onlyOwner {
    require(newContract != address(0), "Invalid new contract address");
    require(Address.isContract(newContract), "Address: migration target is not a contract");

    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    require(balance > 0, "No funds to migrate");

    (bool success, ) = newContract.call{value: balance}("");
    require(success, "Failed to send funds");
