// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function nor does it exhibit the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability directly in the provided code.
// However, to address concerns related to potential locked funds (as indicated by the "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" vulnerability),
// make sure that there is a mechanism to withdraw any funds that might get stuck. Since there's no beginMigration function provided or mentioned,
// I'll add a generic function to illustrate how you might allow the contract owner to withdraw all funds, thereby addressing potential locked fund concerns.
