// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any explicit vulnerability related to locked funds as described.
// However, to address concerns regarding the safe withdrawal of funds, or "locked money", 
// one might consider implementing emergency withdrawal patterns or ensuring that contract functions 
// managing funds have proper access controls and checks.
// Since the provided contract doesn't specify such a function, here's a general improvement 
// to enhance the safety regarding fund management:

// Example addition to Escrow contract for enabling safer fund withdrawal in emergency cases:

function emergencyWithdraw() public onlyOwner {
    // Allow contract owner to withdraw all funds in case of an emergency.
    // This must be used with caution and as a last resort, as it centralizes control over the funds.
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    payable(owner()).sendValue(balance);
    // Emit an event or add further logic as needed
}
