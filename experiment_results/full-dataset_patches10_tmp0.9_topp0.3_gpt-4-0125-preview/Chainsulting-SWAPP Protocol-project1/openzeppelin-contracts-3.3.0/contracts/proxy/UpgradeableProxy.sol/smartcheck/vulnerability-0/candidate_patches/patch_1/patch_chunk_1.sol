// This code does not contain a beginMigration() function or an explicit vulnerability in the provided functions.
// However, to address a common issue related to locked funds in proxy contracts (assuming that's the context of the task),
// one would typically ensure that there are mechanisms for fund management, including withdrawal or migration.
// Given no specific beginMigration() function was provided, here's an illustrative example of how such a function might be implemented,
// ensuring only authorized users can trigger it, and it safely interacts with another contract to migrate funds.

// Note: This is a hypothetical implementation as the original request did not include a specific beginMigration() function.
// Adjustments might be necessary to fit the actual contract's architecture and requirements.
