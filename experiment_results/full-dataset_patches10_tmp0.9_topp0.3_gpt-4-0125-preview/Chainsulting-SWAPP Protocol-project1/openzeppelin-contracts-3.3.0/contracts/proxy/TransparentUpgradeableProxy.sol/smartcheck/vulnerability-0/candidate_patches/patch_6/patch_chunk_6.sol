// No specific function with vulnerabilities related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY was provided in the given code.
// However, ensuring that the contract can release funds or doesn't unintentionally lock them can be addressed
// by adding a withdraw function or similar mechanisms to manage funds in contracts that handle ether.
// Since the provided code does not contain a direct function responsible for handling or locking funds
// (apart from receiving and forwarding calls including ether transactions), there's no specific function to correct
// for the mentioned vulnerability. Contracts like these serve as intermediaries for delegation and do not directly manage funds.

// If needing to ensure funds can be extracted or managed in a contract designed to hold funds, consider implementing:
/*
function withdraw() public {
    // Implementation details e.g., onlyOwner, specific conditions
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
}
*/
// This is a hypothetical solution as the provided contracts primarily deal with proxy functionality rather than fund management.
