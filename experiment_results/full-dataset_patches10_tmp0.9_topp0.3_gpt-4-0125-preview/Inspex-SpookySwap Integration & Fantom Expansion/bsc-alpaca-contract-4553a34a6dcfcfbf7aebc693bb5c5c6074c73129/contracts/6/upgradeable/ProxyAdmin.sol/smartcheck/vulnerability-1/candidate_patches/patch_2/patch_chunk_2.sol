// This contract does not contain a "beginMigration" function as described. However, based on the provided context and the analysis results indicating a vulnerability named "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" in the "AdminUpgradeabilityProxy" contract, it seems the concern might be about funds potentially getting locked in the contract without a way to recover them. Since the exact function to address this issue isn't provided, below is a hypothetical function that could be added to the "AdminUpgradeabilityProxy" contract to allow the recovery of Ether sent to this contract by mistake. This is a common mitigation approach for the mentioned vulnerability.

// Hypothetical function to address SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue:
function recoverLockedEther(address payable recipient) external ifAdmin {
    require(recipient != address(0), "Cannot send to zero address");
    recipient.transfer(address(this).balance);
}
