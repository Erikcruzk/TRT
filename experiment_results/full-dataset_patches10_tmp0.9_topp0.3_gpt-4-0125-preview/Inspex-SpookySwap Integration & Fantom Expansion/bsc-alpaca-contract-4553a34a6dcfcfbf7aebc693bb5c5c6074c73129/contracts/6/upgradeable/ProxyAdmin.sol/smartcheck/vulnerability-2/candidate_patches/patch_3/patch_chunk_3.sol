// This contract does not contain a function specifically named beginMigration(), 
// and the vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) generally refers to contracts 
// locking funds without a way to retrieve them. Since no direct function or mechanism 
// is provided in the given code to withdraw or manage funds sent to the contracts, 
// there's no specific function to correct for that vulnerability. However, adding a 
// withdraw function to the ProxyAdmin or another relevant contract could mitigate it. 
// Below is a hypothetical example of how this could be implemented in the ProxyAdmin contract.

function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    payable(owner()).transfer(address(this).balance);
}
