// There is no function directly named `beginMigration` in the provided code. 
// Given the context, it seems the request could be about initiating a proxy upgrade or similar operation which isn't directly shown in the provided code snippets.
// However, based on common patterns seen in upgradeable contracts, an example implementation handling an upgrade initiation (migration) securely could look like this:

// Note: This is a hypothetical function and may not directly align with the user's exact requirements.
// It also assumes that such a function could be part of the `ProxyAdmin` or similar contract managing upgrades.

    // Hypothetical function to safely begin migration (upgrade) of a smart contract
