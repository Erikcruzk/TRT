// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(). As specified, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function or the whole contract is to be provided. Since the issue seems to be related to locked funds in the contract without a clear mechanism to withdraw or manage them, no specific function like beginMigration() exists in the provided code that addresses this issue directly. Therefore, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or mismatch in the request details concerning the provided code.
