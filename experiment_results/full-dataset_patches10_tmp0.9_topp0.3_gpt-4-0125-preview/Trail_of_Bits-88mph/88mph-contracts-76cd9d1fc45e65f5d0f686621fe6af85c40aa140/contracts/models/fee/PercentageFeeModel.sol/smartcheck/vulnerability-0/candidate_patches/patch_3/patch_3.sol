// This Solidity code snippet does not include a function named `beginMigration()`.
// Given the context and the analysis results, there's no specific function to fix based on the provided details.
// The vulnerability mentioned, SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY, typically refers to contracts that unintentionally lock funds without a way to withdraw them, but no direct relation to a function named `beginMigration()` was provided in the given code.
