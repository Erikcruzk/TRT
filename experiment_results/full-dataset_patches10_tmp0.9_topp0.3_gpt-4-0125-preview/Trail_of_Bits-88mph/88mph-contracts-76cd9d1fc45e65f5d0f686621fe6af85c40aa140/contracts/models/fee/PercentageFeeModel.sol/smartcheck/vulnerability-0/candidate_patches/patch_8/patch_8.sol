// There is no beginMigration() function or any other function directly named as vulnerable based on the shared code and analyzers' results.
// The reported issue does not relate to a specific function that needs fixing. Instead, it points out a general concern of potentially locking funds,
// which is usually mitigated by ensuring there are ways to withdraw or transfer all funds from the contract appropriately.
