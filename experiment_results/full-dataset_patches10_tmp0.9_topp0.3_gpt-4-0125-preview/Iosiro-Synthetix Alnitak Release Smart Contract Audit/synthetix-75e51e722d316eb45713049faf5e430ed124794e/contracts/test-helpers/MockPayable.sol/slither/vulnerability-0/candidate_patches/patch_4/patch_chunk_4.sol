// This is not directly related to the mentioned vulnerability of locked-ether.
// The provided code snippet for the function does not exhibit a locked-ether issue by itself.
// It correctly accepts ether and increments a counter. 
// Instead, it seems like the inquiry might be focused on a different aspect of the contract or possibly a misunderstanding. 
// However, without a clear indication of an actual vulnerability in the provided function or additional context on the contract's remaining parts, 
// it's challenging to offer a precise fix or improvement.
// The reported issue might be related to the overall contract design or other functions not provided in the snippet.
