This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

slither Analysis Results
Vulnerability: locked-ether found in the following piece of code:

    function pay() external payable {

        require(msg.value > 0, "No value paid");

        paidTimes = paidTimes + 1;


The contract is among the source code below:



pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

contract MockPayable {
    uint256 public paidTimes;

    function pay() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "No value paid");
        paidTimes = paidTimes + 1;
    }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
