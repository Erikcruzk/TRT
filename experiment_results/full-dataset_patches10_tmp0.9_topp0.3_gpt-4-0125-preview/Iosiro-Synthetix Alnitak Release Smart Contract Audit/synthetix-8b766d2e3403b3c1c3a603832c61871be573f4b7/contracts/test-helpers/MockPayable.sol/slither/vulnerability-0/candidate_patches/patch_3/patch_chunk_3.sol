// No vulnerability related to "locked-ether" was specifically found within the provided function itself.
// The "locked-ether" warning typically indicates a contract can receive ether without a direct way to withdraw it,
// but the provided function does not directly relate to this issue without seeing the rest of the contract.
// Since only the function with the vulnerability is requested and the given function does not exhibit the "locked-ether" issue itself,
// no code modification is necessary based on the provided details.
