// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), nor does it exhibit the vulnerability directly related to locked funds as it doesn't hold ether without a withdraw function. However, to address potential concerns about locked funds, a withdraw function can be added to allow ether to be withdrawn, ensuring no funds are unintentionally locked in the contract.
