// This code does not contain a direct fix since the described issue "locked-ether" does not pertain to a specific vulnerability within the provided "pay" function itself. The function correctly accepts ether and increments a counter. Issues related to "locked ether" typically involve the inability to withdraw ether from a contract, rather than issues with receiving ether as is the case here. To address concerns not visible in the provided snippet, one would need to ensure mechanisms for withdrawing ether are correctly implemented elsewhere in the contract.
