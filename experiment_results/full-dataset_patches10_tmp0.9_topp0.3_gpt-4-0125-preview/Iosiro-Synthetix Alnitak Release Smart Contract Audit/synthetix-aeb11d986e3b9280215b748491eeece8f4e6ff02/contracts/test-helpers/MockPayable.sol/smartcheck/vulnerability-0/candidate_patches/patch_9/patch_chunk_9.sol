// This contract does not contain a vulnerability directly related to the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY report from smartcheck. 
// The report might be a false positive or misunderstood, as the provided contract code does not lock funds in a manner
// that prevents their withdrawal or usage. However, if there was concern about locked funds without a withdrawal mechanism, 
// adding a withdraw function can mitigate such concerns. This is not directly fixing a reported vulnerability but addressing 
// potential concerns related to fund management:

function withdraw(address payable _to, uint256 _amount) public {
    require(_amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance");
    _to.transfer(_amount);
}
