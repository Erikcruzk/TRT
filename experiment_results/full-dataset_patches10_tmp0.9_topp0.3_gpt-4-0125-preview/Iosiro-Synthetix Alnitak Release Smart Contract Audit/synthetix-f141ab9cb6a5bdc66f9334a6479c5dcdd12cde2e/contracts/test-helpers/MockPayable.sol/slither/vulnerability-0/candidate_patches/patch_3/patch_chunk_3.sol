// This code does not contain a function named beginMigration() and thus cannot be corrected as per the user's initial request.
// However, based on the provided context, here is the corrected code for the pay() function addressing the locked-ether issue:

pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

contract MockPayable {
    uint256 public paidTimes;

    function pay() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "No value paid");
        paidTimes = paidTimes + 1;
    }

    // Additional functionality to withdraw the ether, resolving the locked-ether issue.
    address payable owner;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
