// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), 
// and no specific vulnerable function was directly mentioned related to the provided vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY).
// However, to address the general concern of locked funds in a contract without a withdrawal function,
// here's an example of how you might implement a withdraw function in such a contract:

pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

contract MockPayable {

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;

        paidTimes = paidTimes + 1;
    }

    function beginMigration() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can begin migration");
        selfdestruct(owner);
    }
}
