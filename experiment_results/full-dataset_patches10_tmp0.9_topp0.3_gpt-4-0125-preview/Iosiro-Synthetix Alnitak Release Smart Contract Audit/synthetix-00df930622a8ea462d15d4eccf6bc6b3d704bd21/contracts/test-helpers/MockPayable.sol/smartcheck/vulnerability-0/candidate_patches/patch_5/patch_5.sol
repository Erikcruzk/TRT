// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), and no explicit vulnerability related to locked funds in the provided function. The provided code snippet only includes a basic payment function without any function to withdraw funds or similar. Therefore, there's no direct fix applicable to the function pay() regarding the "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" issue without additional context or requirements for fund withdrawal or contract migration mechanisms.
