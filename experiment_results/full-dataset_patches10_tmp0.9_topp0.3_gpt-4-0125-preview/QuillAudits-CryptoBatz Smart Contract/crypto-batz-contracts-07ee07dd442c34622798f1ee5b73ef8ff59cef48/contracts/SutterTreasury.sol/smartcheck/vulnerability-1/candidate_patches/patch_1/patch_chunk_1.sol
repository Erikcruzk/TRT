// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any functions related to migration.
// As per the instruction to only return the specified function or address the vulnerability directly,
// and given no direct mention or implementation of beginMigration, it's not possible to provide the code for it.
// If the concern is about the locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) issue, it's typically due to the lack of
// a function to release or manage funds properly. However, the provided contract already includes mechanisms
// for releasing funds (withdrawAll, release) to address this concern.
