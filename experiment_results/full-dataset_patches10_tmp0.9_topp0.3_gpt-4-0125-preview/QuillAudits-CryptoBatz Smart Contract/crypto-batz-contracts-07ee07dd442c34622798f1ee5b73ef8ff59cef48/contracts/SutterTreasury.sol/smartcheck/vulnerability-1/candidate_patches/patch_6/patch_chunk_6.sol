// The provided contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any clear description of a vulnerability within a specific function that needs fixing.
// However, based on the feedback related to "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY", here is an implementation of a hypothetical 'beginMigration' function that might address common concerns related to locked funds in a contract.
// Please ensure the actual context of the vulnerability and function is correctly understood, as the below example might not directly apply.
