// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any direct vulnerability related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY based on the provided code.

Ensure the implementation of withdrawal or fund management functionalities aligns with the contract's intended behavior to prevent funds from being unintentionally locked.
