// This code has no direct fix as the vulnerability described (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) is inherent to the use of selfdestruct. 
// The use of selfdestruct is considered a vulnerability in many contexts because it can forcefully send Ether 
// to an address without invoking the fallback function, potentially locking Ether in contracts not designed to receive it.
// If the goal is to safely send Ether without the risk of locking it in contracts inadvertently, consider using a pattern 
// that involves checking the contract code size to prevent sending Ether to contracts, or directly transferring Ether 
// to EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) addresses only.

// Below is the original provided code without modifications as there's no direct 'fix' to the mentioned vulnerability 
// without changing the intended functionality of forcefully sending Ether via selfdestruct.
