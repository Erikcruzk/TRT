// There's no beginMigration() function in the given code snippet or any direct mention of a vulnerability related to "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY".
// However, to address the general concern of locked funds in a contract, below is an example function that can be added to the KyberNetworkTestMockContract
// to allow the contract owner to withdraw Ether, potentially fixing the "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" issue by ensuring that funds are not permanently locked in the contract.
// Always ensure to appropriately restrict access to such critical functions.
