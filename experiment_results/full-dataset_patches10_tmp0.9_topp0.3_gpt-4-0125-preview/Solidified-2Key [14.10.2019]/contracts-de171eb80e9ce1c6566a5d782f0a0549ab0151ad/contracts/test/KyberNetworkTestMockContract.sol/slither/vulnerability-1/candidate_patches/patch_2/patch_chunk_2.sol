// The provided code does not contain a function named beginMigration(), and the vulnerability mentioned is related to shadowing state variables.
// There seems to be a misunderstanding or incorrect task description as no function named beginMigration() is present in the provided contracts.
// Therefore, I'm providing a fix for the shadowing issue mentioned in the analysis results instead.

// Fixes for variable shadowing in FungibleMockToken contract:
contract FungibleMockToken is StandardTokenModified {
    
    // Removed the re-declared state variables to fix the shadowing issue.
    // 'name', 'symbol', and 'decimals' variables are inherited from StandardTokenModified and should not be re-declared.

    constructor (string _name, string _symbol, address _owner) public {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;

        decimals = 18;
        totalSupply_= 1000000000000000000000000000; 
        balances[_owner]= totalSupply_;
    }
