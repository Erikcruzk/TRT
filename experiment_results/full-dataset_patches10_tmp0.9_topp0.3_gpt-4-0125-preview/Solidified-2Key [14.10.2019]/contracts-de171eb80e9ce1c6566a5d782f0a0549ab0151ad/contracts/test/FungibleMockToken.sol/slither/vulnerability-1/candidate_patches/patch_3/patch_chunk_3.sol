// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or any direct mention of a vulnerability within a specific function based on the given context.
// However, it's noticed that there's a redeclaration issue with the "symbol" and "name" variables in the FungibleMockToken which inherit from StandardTokenModified where these variables are already declared.
// Since beginMigration() function was not found or stated, and the task specifies fixing vulnerabilities in it, but it's not present, below is a resolved version of variable shadowing issue by removing redeclarations from FungibleMockToken:

contract FungibleMockToken is StandardTokenModified {

    uint8 public decimals;

    constructor (string _name, string _symbol, address _owner) public {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;

        decimals = 18;
        totalSupply_= 1000000000000000000000000000; 
        balances[_owner]= totalSupply_;
    }
}
