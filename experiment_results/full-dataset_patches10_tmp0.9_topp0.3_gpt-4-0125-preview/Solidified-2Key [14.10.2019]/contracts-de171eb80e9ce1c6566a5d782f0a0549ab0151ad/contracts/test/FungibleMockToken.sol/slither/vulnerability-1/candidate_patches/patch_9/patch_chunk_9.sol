// There's no specific function named beginMigration() in the provided contract code.
// However, if you're looking for a fix to the shadowing issue mentioned in the analysis, here's a potential solution:

// In the FungibleMockToken contract, we can rename the local variables to avoid shadowing the inherited variables.
// Since there's no explicit beginMigration() function to correct, below is a corrected version of the FungibleMockToken constructor to avoid shadowing state variables:

constructor (string _name, string _symbol, address _owner) public {
    name = _name;
    symbol = _symbol;

    decimals = 18;
    totalSupply_ = 1000000000000000000000000000; 
    balances[_owner] = totalSupply_;
}
