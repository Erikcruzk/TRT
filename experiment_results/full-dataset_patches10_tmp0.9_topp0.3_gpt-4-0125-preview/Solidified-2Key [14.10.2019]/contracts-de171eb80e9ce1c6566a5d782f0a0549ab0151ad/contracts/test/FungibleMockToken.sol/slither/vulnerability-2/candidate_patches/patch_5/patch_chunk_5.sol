// There's no function `beginMigration()` present in the provided code. The instructions seem to ask for a fix related to the identified vulnerability, which was about state variable shadowing. Since there isn't a direct request to fix a function named `beginMigration()`, I'll address the shadowing issue found in the provided code snippet. 

// The shadowing issue is within the FungibleMockToken contract. The state variables name, symbol, and decimals are declared both in FungibleMockToken and its parent, StandardTokenModified, which is not a direct vulnerability in the function `beginMigration()` as no such function exists in the provided code. However, to address the shadowing issue:

// Original shadowed declarations in FungibleMockToken:
/*
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint8 public decimals;
*/

// To address the shadowing state variables, remove or comment out the shadowing declarations in the `FungibleMockToken` contract and utilize the ones in `StandardTokenModified`. If customization is needed, it should be done in the constructor or through functions without redeclaring these variables.
