// This function is not present in the provided code. 
// Since no specific vulnerability-ridden function named beginMigration() is found in the given code, 
// it's not possible to directly correct it.
// In case of locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY), generally ensure that:
// 1. The contract has a way to transfer Ether out of it (e.g., a withdraw function).
// 2. There are no functions that can lock Ether indefinitely without a way to retrieve it.
// Since the provided code does not include a function named beginMigration(), 
// please check your request and provide the correct function name or the issue you aim to address.
