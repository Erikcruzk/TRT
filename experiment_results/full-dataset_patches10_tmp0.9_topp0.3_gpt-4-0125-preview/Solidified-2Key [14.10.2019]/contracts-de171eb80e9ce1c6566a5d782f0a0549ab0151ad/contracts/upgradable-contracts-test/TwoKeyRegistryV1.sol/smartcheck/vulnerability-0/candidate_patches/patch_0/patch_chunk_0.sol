// The provided code does not include a beginMigration() function directly.
// Thus, based on the context, there appears to be a misunderstanding or missing portion of the code.
// Since the task is to fix vulnerabilities specifically in the beginMigration() function,
// and without the actual function to work on, I'll provide a generic secure template for a migration function in Solidity,
// assuming the vulnerability might be related to unauthorized access or improper handling:

// Example secure template for a migration function in a Solidity contract:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract SecureMigration {
    address public owner;
    bool public migrationCompleted;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can perform this operation.");
        _;
    }

    modifier migrationNotCompleted() {
        require(!migrationCompleted, "Migration has already been completed.");
        _;
    }

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        migrationCompleted = false;
    }

    function beginMigration() public onlyOwner migrationNotCompleted {
        migrationCompleted = true;
        // Additional migration logic here
    }
}
