// This code snippet is provided based on the above request which does not specifically ask for a function named "beginMigration".
// However, based on the vulnerability pointed out by the analysis (uninitialized-state in _implementation),
// a potential fix could involve properly initializing this state variable in the appropriate function or constructor.
// Below is an illustrative example of how one might address such an issue in a constructor or initialization function:

contract ExampleContract is UpgradeabilityStorage {

    constructor(address initialImplementation) {
        require(initialImplementation != address(0), "Initial implementation address cannot be 0.");
        _implementation = initialImplementation;
    }

    // Alternatively, if the contract uses an initialization pattern instead of a constructor:
    function initialize(address initialImplementation) public {
        require(_implementation == address(0), "Already initialized.");
        require(initialImplementation != address(0), "Initial implementation address cannot be 0.");
        _implementation = initialImplementation;
    }
}
