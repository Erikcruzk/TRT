This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

Vulnerability: calls-loop found in the following piece of code:

      uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(this);


The contract is among the source code below:



pragma solidity ^0.4.24;







contract Ownable {
  address public owner;


  event OwnershipRenounced(address indexed previousOwner);
  event OwnershipTransferred(
    address indexed previousOwner,
    address indexed newOwner
  );


  



  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  


  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    _;
  }

  





  function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {
    emit OwnershipRenounced(owner);
    owner = address(0);
  }

  



  function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    _transferOwnership(_newOwner);
  }

  



  function _transferOwnership(address _newOwner) internal {
    require(_newOwner != address(0));
    emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, _newOwner);
    owner = _newOwner;
  }
}



pragma solidity ^0.4.24;







contract ERC20Basic {
  function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256);
  function balanceOf(address _who) public view returns (uint256);
  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool);
  function allowance(address _ocwner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256);
  function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
  function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool);

  event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
  event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
}



pragma solidity ^0.4.24;








contract TokenDestructible is Ownable {

  constructor() public payable { }

  






  function destroy(address[] _tokens) public onlyOwner {

    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
      ERC20Basic token = ERC20Basic(_tokens[i]);
      uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(this);
      token.transfer(owner, balance);
    }

    
    selfdestruct(owner);
  }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
