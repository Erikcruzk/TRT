// This contract does not contain a function explicitly named beginMigration() 
// and the identified vulnerability is about uninitialized-state in a mapping, not a specific function.
// Therefore, directly fixing a function named beginMigration() is not applicable here.
// Please, provide the correct function or context for repair.
