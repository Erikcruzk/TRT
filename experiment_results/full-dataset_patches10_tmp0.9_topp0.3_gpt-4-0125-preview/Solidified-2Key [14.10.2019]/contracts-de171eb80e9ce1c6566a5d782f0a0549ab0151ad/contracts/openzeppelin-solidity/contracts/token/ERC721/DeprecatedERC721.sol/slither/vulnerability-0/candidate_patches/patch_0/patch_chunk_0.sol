The provided Solidity smart contract code snippet does not contain a function called `beginMigration()`. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a corrected version of this specific function. Instead, an analysis of vulnerabilities related to the ERC721, ERC721Basic, ERC721Enumerable, ERC721Metadata, and DeprecatedERC721 contracts was requested. However, without a specific function to analyze or modify, no code changes can be suggested. Please provide the relevant function or clarify the request.
