// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(), 
// and the provided analysis and code snippets do not directly reference or 
// imply a function by that name or a related vulnerability in the context of migration. 
// The provided Solidity code pertains to ERC721 token standard interfaces and their implementation,
// which does not inherently include migration functionality. Without further context 
// or clarification on the specific migration functionality or its requirements,
// generating a corrected or secure implementation of a non-existent function is not feasible.
