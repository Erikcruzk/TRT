// This Solidity code snippet does not directly correspond to a specific function with a vulnerability as indicated in the provided analyzer results. The analysis results mention an "erc20-interface" vulnerability but the provided code is related to the ERC721 standard. Therefore, I'll provide a generic Solidity implementation for a hypothetical `beginMigration` function that you may be seeking to fix vulnerabilities for, assuming it's related to contract upgradeability or migration given the context.

// Note: This is a speculative implementation based on common practices for migration functions in upgradeable contracts and does not directly address the "erc20-interface" issue mentioned in the analyzer results, as it's unrelated to the provided ERC721 code.
