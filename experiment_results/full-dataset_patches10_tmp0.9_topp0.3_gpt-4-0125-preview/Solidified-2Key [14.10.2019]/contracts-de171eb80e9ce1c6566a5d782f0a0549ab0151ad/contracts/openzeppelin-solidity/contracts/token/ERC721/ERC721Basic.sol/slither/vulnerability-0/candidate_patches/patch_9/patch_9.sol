// This provided code snippet does not directly contain a beginMigration() function.
// As per instructions, only a compilable version of a potentially vulnerable beginMigration() function should be provided.
// Given the context and typical vulnerabilities, a hypothetical fixed version of a beginMigration() function might look as follows:

    constructor() public {

    // Hypothetical beginMigration function with basic access control fix.
    function beginMigration() public onlyOwner {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration already started");
