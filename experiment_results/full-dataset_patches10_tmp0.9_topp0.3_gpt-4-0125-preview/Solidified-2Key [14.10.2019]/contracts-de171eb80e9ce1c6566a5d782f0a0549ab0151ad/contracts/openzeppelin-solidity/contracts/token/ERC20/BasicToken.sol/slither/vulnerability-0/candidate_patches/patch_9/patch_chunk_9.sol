// There's no beginMigration() function in the provided code.
// Responding with a fixed version of the contract related to the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract BasicToken is ERC20Basic {
  using SafeMath for uint256;

  mapping(address => uint256) internal balances;

  uint256 internal totalSupply_; // This was marked as an uninitialized state variable. However, the issue cited (uninitialized-state) does not directly apply as there's no function shown to initialize this variable incorrectly. It's a typical pattern to initialize state variables like totalSupply_ in a constructor or a specific initialization function which is not shown here.

  string public name;
  string public symbol;
  uint8 public decimals;
  bool public frozen = false;

  // Assuming the issue was with properly initializing `totalSupply_`, 
  // a constructor or an initialization function should be added to correctly initialize `totalSupply_` if not already present.

  constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    totalSupply_ = _initialSupply;
    balances[msg.sender] = _initialSupply; // Assuming the total supply goes to the contract creator initially
  }

  function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
    return totalSupply_;
  }

  //...
