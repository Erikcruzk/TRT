// There is no function named `beginMigration` in the provided code.
// If you meant to identify and fix the vulnerability related to the uninitialized state variable `roles` in the RBAC contract, the direct vulnerability fix isn't about a specific function. The uninitialized state would be an issue if there were direct interactions that led to security flaws without proper initialization. However, since the concern is about ensuring that the mapping `roles` is correctly used, let's ensure proper role management through its functions. Below is an example of how role management is properly initialized and used, which is indirectly related to preventing misuse of the uninitialized state of `roles`.

// Since there is no specific function to fix based on your query, and the code provided doesn't directly initialize `roles` in a way that's typically considered vulnerable (given that mappings in Solidity are virtually initialized to their default values), there's no specific "fix" to apply without a clearer context of misuse. The `RBAC` contract provided already includes mechanisms for safely adding and checking roles.

// If you have a different function or another specific issue in mind that needs addressing, please provide more details.
