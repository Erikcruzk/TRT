// This contract does not contain a function specifically named `beginMigration()`, and the mentioned vulnerability pertains to the initialization of a state variable `mapping (string => Roles.Role) private roles;` in the `RBAC` contract. Since there's no direct function to demonstrate or fix this particular vulnerability and based on the provided context, there's no specific function to correct for the uninitialized-state vulnerability.

// For better clarity or if you're looking for a particular operation to be performed on the `roles` mapping that addresses a common pattern or best practice in Solidity, please provide further details or specify the operation. Solidity mappings do not have a direct mechanism for initialization as they virtually exist for all possible keys with default values.
