// This Solidity code snippet does not directly correspond to the vulnerability mentioned. 
// There is no explicit function or contract component named beginMigration() provided in the given code.
// However, I'll provide a hypothetical function based on the context that addresses the uninitialized-state vulnerability in a general manner.

// Assuming the goal is to initialize a state within a function in a way that addresses the 'uninitialized-state' vulnerability:
function beginMigration() public onlyOwner {
    // Hypothetical migration logic here
    // For instance, initializing roles if they haven't been initialized yet to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability
    // Note: Solidity ^0.4.24 syntax and features are used, as per the provided code base.

    // Example initialization check and action (This is a generic placeholder. Actual implementation will vary based on contract requirements)
    string memory defaultRole = "defaultRole";
    if (!hasRole(address(0), defaultRole)) {
        addRole(address(0), defaultRole); // This is a simplistic example. In practice, you'd likely be initializing more meaningful states or configurations.
    }

    // Further migration logic...
