// This Solidity code excerpt does not directly contain a function named `beginMigration()`. 
// The provided code does not showcase the specific function you're asking to fix. 
// Since the issue highlighted pertains to an uninitialized-state vulnerability concerning the `roles` mapping in the `RBAC` contract,
// and no function `beginMigration()` is provided in the given code, it's not possible to return a fixed version of `beginMigration()`.

// However, the uninitialized-state warning typically refers to the potential risks of having state variables that are not initialized
// within the contract's constructor or at the point of declaration, which is not directly applicable here since mappings in Solidity
// do not have a "not initialized" state in the same way that other variable types do. Mappings by default map to zero/false for all
// possible keys until explicitly set. The provided code does not show a direct misuse or a pattern that would lead to uninitialized
// state vulnerabilities within the visible context.

// Please provide the correct function code or further details if assistance is needed with a specific part of the contract.
