// No vulnerable function code provided directly. Based on the context, the contract contains a vulnerability related to locked funds without a specific function to address it. Since there's no direct function to fix based on the provided code and the mentioned vulnerability, here's a generic approach to allow fund withdrawal:

// Adding a withdraw function to Upgradeable contract to fix potentially locked funds
function withdraw() public {
    require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only the registry can trigger a withdrawal
    address contractAddress = this;
    registry.transfer(contractAddress.balance); // Transfer all funds to the registry
}
