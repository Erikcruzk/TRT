// No specific function with a vulnerability is highlighted in the provided code. 
// The concern raised pertains to the entire contract Upgradeable potentially locking funds without a way to withdraw them. 
// However, without a specific function to focus on, providing a fix for a nonexistent "beginMigration" function or similar is not possible based on given details. 

// Assuming a hypothetical scenario where a "beginMigration" function could exist and addressing the concern of locked funds, 
// a safe withdrawal pattern could be implemented as follows:

// Hypothetical Safe Withdrawal Function Implementation (Not originally present in the provided code)

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Additional hypothetical function to handle potential locked funds safely
    function beginMigration(address newAddress) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only authorized entity can initiate migration
        require(newAddress != address(0)); // Ensure the new address is not the zero address

        // Logic to migrate funds or state to newAddress could be added here
        // For example, transferring balance to a new contract:
        // newAddress.transfer(address(this).balance);
        
        // Emit an event for the migration (hypothetical, depending on your specific needs)
