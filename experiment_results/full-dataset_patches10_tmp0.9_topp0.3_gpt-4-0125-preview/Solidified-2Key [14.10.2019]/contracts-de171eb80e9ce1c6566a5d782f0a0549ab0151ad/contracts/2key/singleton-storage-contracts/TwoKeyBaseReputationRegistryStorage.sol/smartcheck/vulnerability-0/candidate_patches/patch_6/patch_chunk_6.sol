// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any specific vulnerable function as detailed in the user's request.
// Instead, the provided contracts set a framework for upgradeable contracts and storage management.
// Since no specific function like beginMigration() was provided in the given contracts, there's no direct way to address the vulnerability without more context.
