// The given analysis result "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" generally refers to contracts that might hold funds without a way to withdraw them.
// Since the specific function to address is not provided, and no function named beginMigration is present in the provided code,
// it's not possible to provide a direct fix. Below is an example of how to safely withdraw funds from a contract, which might be relevant
// if the intention was to address potential issues related to locked funds in a contract structure resembling the provided ones.
