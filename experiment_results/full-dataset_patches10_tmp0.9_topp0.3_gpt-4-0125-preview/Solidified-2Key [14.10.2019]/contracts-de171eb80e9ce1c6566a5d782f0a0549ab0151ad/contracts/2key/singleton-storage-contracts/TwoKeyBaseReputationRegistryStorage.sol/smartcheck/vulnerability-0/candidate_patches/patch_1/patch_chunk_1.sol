// This contract does not contain a function named `beginMigration`. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a fixed version of a function that does not exist in the provided contract code. The vulnerability mentioned is related to the general pattern of locked funds in contracts without payable functions or withdrawal mechanisms, but without a specific function or further details, no actionable code change can be provided.
