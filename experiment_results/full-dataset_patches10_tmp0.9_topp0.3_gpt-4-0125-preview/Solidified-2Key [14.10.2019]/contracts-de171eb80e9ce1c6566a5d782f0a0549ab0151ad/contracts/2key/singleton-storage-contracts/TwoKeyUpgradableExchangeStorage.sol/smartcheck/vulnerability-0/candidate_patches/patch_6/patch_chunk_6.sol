// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any other specific function that can be directly correlated with the vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY). 
// Therefore, there's no specific function to provide a fix for. The provided contracts primarily deal with upgradeability and storage structures without explicit handling of Ether or mechanisms for locking funds.
