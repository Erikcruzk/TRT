// There's no beginMigration() function in the provided Solidity code.
// As per your request, here is a templated example that you might be considering for implementation,
// ensuring it initializes any necessary state to prevent vulnerabilities.

function beginMigration() public {
    // Ensure this function can only be called by an authorized entity,
    // for example, the contract owner or a specific administrative account.
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");

    // Initialize the ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry to a valid address before it's being used.
    // For example, assuming `owner` can set the registry address:
    require(address(registry) != address(0), "Registry not initialized");

    // Example migration logic here
    // e.g., updating contract state, moving funds, changing permissions, etc.
