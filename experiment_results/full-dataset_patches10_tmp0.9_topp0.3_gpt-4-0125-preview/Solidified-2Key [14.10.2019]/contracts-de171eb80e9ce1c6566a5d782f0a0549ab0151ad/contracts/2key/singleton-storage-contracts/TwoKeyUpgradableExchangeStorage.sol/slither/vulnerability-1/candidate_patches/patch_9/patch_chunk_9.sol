// This code snippet is not directly related to the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned.
// The uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned pertains to the `_implementation` variable in `UpgradeabilityStorage`.
// However, the user has requested the `beginMigration` function specifically, which is not provided in the original code snippet.
// Since the `beginMigration` function is not part of the provided code, below is a template function that could be potentially used
// to address some form of upgradeability or migration logic, incorporating basic safety checks.
// Note: This is a hypothetical addition and should be customized as per actual contract requirements.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    address internal _implementation;
    // Additional contract code...

    // Hypothetical beginMigration function
    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner); // Ensure only the contract owner can initiate the migration.
        require(newImplementation != address(0)); // Ensure the new implementation address is not zero.
        _implementation = newImplementation;
        // Emit an event or add further logic as needed.
    }

    // Additional contract code...
