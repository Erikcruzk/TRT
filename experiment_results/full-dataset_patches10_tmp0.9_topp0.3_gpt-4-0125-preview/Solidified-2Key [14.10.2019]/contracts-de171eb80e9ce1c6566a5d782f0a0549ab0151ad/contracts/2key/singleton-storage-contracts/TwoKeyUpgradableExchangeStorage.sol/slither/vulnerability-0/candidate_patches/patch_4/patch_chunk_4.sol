// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any direct vulnerabilities 
// related to an uninitialized state variable in a specified function. 
// The vulnerability pointed out is about the uninitialized-state in the registry variable,
// but there's no specific function provided to apply or demonstrate the fix.
// Therefore, a direct fix or modification cannot be applied without further context or 
// specific function details. Below is a general approach to initialize the registry in the constructor
// which could potentially mitigate the uninitialized state variable issue in a broader sense.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

// Hypothetical constructor addition for UpgradeabilityStorage contract to demonstrate
// how to potentially address the uninitialized-state vulnerability for `registry`. 
// Note: Since the original request does not mention or provide a `beginMigration()` function, 
// this code serves as an example of initializing the `registry` variable, which might not be directly related
// to the user's request but addresses the vulnerability mentioned from the analysis.

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Example constructor to initialize the registry state variable
    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        registry = _registry;
