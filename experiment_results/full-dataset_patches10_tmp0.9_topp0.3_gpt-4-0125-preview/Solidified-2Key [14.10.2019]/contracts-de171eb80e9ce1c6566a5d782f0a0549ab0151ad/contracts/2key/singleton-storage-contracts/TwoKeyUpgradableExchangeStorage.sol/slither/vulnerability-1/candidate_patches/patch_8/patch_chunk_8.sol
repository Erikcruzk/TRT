// This code snippet does not include a direct function named beginMigration(), and the mentioned vulnerability
// pertains to an uninitialized state variable. Given the context, there's no specific function to fix based on the
// provided description. However, the issue highlighted involves the uninitialized state variable `_implementation` in
// the UpgradeabilityStorage contract. Addressing the uninitialized variable issue, one would typically ensure
// initialization happens correctly, either in the constructor or via an initializer function. Since Solidity ^0.4.24
// does not support constructors in interfaces or direct variable initialization in inherited contracts for upgradeable
// patterns, one approach is to ensure `_implementation` is set upon contract deployment or initialization.

// Since there's no specific function `beginMigration()` to correct, and based on the context provided, below is an
// illustrative example of how one might introduce an initializer function to set the `_implementation` address.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Initializer function to set the implementation address
    function initializeImplementation(address _impl) public {
        // Ensure the initializer can only be called once, possibly by including additional state checks
        // For the purpose of this example, a simple condition to check if `_implementation` is already set is used.
        // More complex upgradeability contracts utilize permissions or other checks to manage upgrades.
        require(_implementation == address(0), "Implementation already initialized.");
        _implementation = _impl;
    }
