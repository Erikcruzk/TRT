// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any explicit vulnerability related to locked funds directly in the provided code.
// However, to address the general concern of locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) in an upgradeable contract pattern, 
// a typical solution involves adding functionality to migrate funds to a new version of the contract safely. 
// Since the direct request was for a beginMigration function, which is not part of the provided contracts, 
// below is an example implementation that could be added to the Upgradeable contract to illustrate how one might begin addressing the concern.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    // Existing code...

    // Example function to safely begin migration of funds to a new contract version.
    // Implementers need to ensure that appropriate checks and permissions are in place.
    // This is a simplistic example for illustration purposes.
    function beginMigration(address newVersion) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only the registry or another authorized entity can initiate the migration.
        require(newVersion != address(0)); // Prevent migration to a zero address.

        address currentVersion = implementation();
        require(currentVersion != newVersion); // Prevent migration to the same contract.

        uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
        require(contractBalance > 0); // Proceed only if there are funds to migrate.

        // Add logic here to update the state, if necessary, before transferring funds.

        // Transfer funds to the new contract version.
        // It is critical to ensure that the newVersion address is a contract 
        // that can accept and manage the funds correctly to avoid permanent loss of funds.
        newVersion.transfer(contractBalance);

        // Emit an event or add further logic as needed to finalize the migration process.
        // For example, updating internal state to reflect the migration status.
    }

    // Reminder: This is a simplified example. Actual implementation requires careful consideration of security, 
    // permissions, and compatibility with the overall contract architecture and upgradeability mechanism.
