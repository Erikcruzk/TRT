// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function nor does it directly present an uninitialized-state vulnerability related to a specific function. 
// The uninitialized-state issue mentioned points to the lack of initialization for the 'registry' variable in the UpgradeabilityStorage contract,
// but there's no specific function like beginMigration to correct in the provided code.
