// This is a correction based on the provided context. There's no specific `beginMigration` function given, but to address the identified concerns related to locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY), a withdraw function would typically be implemented to allow the extraction of funds if necessary. This is a hypothetical implementation since the original request does not specify the exact function or vulnerability location.
