// The provided code does not contain a function named beginMigration(). However, based on the vulnerability flagged (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) and the request for a solution related to a migration function, below is a hypothetical implementation of beginMigration() addressing potential locked money issues typically associated with upgradeable contracts. This function should be viewed as an example of how one might begin to address such concerns within an upgradeable contract context.

function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
    require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Caller must be the registry");
    require(newImplementation != address(0), "New implementation cannot be the zero address");
    // Additional checks can be implemented here to ensure the new implementation contract is valid and ready to migrate to.
    _implementation = newImplementation;
}
