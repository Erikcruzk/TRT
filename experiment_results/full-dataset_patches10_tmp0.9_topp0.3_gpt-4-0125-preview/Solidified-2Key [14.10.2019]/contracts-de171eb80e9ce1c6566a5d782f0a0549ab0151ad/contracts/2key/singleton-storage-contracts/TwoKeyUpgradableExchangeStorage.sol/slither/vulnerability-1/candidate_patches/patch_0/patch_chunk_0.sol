// This code snippet doesn't contain a specific function named beginMigration() 
// and the vulnerability mentioned relates to an uninitialized state variable.
// However, to address the issue regarding the uninitialized state variable '_implementation',
// you might want to ensure it is properly initialized in the contract's constructor or an initialization function.
// Below is an illustrative example of how you could potentially fix this by ensuring '_implementation' is initialized.
