// This is not directly provided in the given code and appears to be a request for additional functionality based on the description.
// Given the context, a possible implementation for beginMigration() that mitigates locking of funds could look like this:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Given that the vulnerability concerns locking of funds, ensuring that funds can be withdrawn or migrated is essential.
    // This function might represent a way to begin a migration process, ensuring that the contract can be upgraded or funds moved without locking.

    // New variable to control the migration status
    bool private migrationStarted;

    // Modifier to control the access to the migration process
    modifier onlyRegistry() {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Caller must be the registry.");
        _;
    }

    function beginMigration() public onlyRegistry {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration has already been started.");
        migrationStarted = true;
        // Additional logic to handle the migration process can be implemented here.
        // For example, emitting an event, notifying external systems, or setting new contract addresses.
    }
