// This function is not directly provided in the provided code. However, addressing the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY 
// vulnerability generally involves ensuring that there are mechanisms to withdraw funds or preventing 
// the contract from accepting funds without a way to retrieve them. 

// Assuming the vulnerability hint and based on the context, a generic solution to address potential 
// locked money issues in an upgradeable contract structure might look like this, including a hypothetical 
// `beginMigration` function that could be part of such a contract.
