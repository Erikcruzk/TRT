// No vulnerable function code provided directly. The description suggests the contract Upgradeable is vulnerable due to locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// but no specific function addressing fund management is provided in the given code.
// Below is an example function that might address the mentioned vulnerability by allowing withdrawal of funds, if it were part of the vulnerability context:

function withdrawBalance() public {
    // Implementation of a withdrawal function to prevent locked funds in the contract
    address payable owner = msg.sender; // Or a specific owner/admin address
    require(owner.send(address(this).balance));
}
