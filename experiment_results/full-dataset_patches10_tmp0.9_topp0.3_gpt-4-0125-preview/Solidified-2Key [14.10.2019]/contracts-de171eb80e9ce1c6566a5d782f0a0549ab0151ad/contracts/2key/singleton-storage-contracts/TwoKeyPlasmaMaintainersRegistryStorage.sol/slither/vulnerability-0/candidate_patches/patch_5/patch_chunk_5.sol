// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function based on the provided code.
// Therefore, no direct code modification can be applied to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned.
// However, the report mentions an "uninitialized-state" vulnerability which typically relates to state variables not being properly initialized.
// Given the context, it would suggest ensuring proper initialization of such variables, but no specific function like beginMigration() is mentioned for direct modification.
