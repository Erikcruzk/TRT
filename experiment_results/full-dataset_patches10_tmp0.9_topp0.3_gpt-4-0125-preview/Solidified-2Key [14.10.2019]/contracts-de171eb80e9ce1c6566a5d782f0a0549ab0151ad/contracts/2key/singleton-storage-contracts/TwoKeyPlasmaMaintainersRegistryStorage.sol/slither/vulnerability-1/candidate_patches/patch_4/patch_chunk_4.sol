// This Solidity code snippet does not directly address the uninitialized-state vulnerability found by the slither analysis, 
// as the issue mentioned pertains to the uninitialized internal variable _implementation in the UpgradeabilityStorage contract.
// However, the user requested the beginMigration() function which was not provided in the initial code snippet. 
// Since the specific function was not included in the given code, 
// here is a generic placeholder implementation for a beginMigration function that could be added to any relevant contract,
// ensuring it properly initializes the _implementation variable or checks for its initialization.

function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
    // Assuming this function should only be callable by a specific role, e.g., contract owner
    // Placeholder for access control mechanism
    require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only the registry can initiate the migration for simplicity

    // Ensure that the `_implementation` variable is not uninitialized (address(0)) before migration
    require(_implementation != address(0), "Current implementation address is uninitialized.");

    // Further logic to begin migration, e.g., setting the new implementation address
    _implementation = newImplementation;

    // Emitting an event or other logic to finalize migration process could follow here
