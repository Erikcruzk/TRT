// There's no specific function named `beginMigration` provided in the provided code.
// However, since the vulnerability mentioned is about an uninitialized state variable (`registry`),
// I'll show an example of how one might properly initialize such a variable in a constructor or an initialization function,
// assuming there could be a function related to migration or initialization logic.

// Example of an initialization function that properly initializes the `registry` state variable:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract ExampleInitializationFunction {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    // Example constructor or initialization function to properly set the 'registry' state variable
    function initializeRegistry(address _registryAddress) public {
        require(_registryAddress != address(0), "Registry address cannot be zero.");
        registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(_registryAddress);
    }
}
