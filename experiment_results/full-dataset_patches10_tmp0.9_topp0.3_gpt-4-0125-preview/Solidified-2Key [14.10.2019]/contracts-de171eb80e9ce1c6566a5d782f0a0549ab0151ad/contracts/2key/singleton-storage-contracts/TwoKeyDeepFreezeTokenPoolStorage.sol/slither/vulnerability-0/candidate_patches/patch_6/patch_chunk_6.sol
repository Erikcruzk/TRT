// This is not directly related to a specific function, but rather to the initialization of a state variable in the contract.
// To address the uninitialized-state vulnerability for `ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;`, ensure it is properly initialized:

// Add a constructor or an initializer function to set the registry address. For example:

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {

    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Constructor to initialize registry
    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
