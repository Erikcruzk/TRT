// The provided code does not have a beginMigration function or an explicit mention of a vulnerability associated with locked money.
// The reported vulnerability suggests a scenario where funds could be permanently locked in a contract.
// However, without a specific function like beginMigration to address, and with the given instruction, it's unclear which part to correct.
// Given the context, here's a generic approach to implementing a safe mechanism in hypothetical beginMigration or similar function that might be added to mitigate such concerns.

// Hypothetical implementation based on the instruction, to be adapted according to actual needs.
