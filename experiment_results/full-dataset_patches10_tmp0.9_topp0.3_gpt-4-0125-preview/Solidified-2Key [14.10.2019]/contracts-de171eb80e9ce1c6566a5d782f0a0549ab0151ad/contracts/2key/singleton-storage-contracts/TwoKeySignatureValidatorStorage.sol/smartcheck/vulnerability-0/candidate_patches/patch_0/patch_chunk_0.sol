// This contract does not directly contain a beginMigration function or an explicit vulnerability associated with SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY.
// However, addressing common patterns that could lead to locked money in contracts like these:
// Ensuring there's a way to migrate or withdraw funds if necessary. Since the specific beginMigration function is not provided,
// a generic implementation to safely upgrade the contract could look like this:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {

        require(newOwner != address(0));
        emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, newOwner);

    }

    // Assume beginMigration is a function to migrate to a new contract.
    // This implementation ensures that only the owner can start the migration,
    // addressing the common locked money vulnerability by allowing funds to be migrated.
