// This contract does not have a beginMigration function or an explicit vulnerability related to locked funds. 
// However, given the task description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. 
// The provided contracts focus on upgradeability and storage structure, with no direct mention or implementation 
// of a function named beginMigration or handling of funds that could be locked in the contract.

// For a general improvement considering the concern of locked funds, one would ensure that there are mechanisms 
// to extract funds or upgrade the contract without locking funds. But without a specific function like beginMigration 
// in the provided code, there's no direct code snippet to correct under the given instructions.
