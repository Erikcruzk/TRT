// There is no explicit beginMigration() function in the provided code. The vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) could relate to improper handling of funds or lack of functionality to withdraw funds from the contract. Given this, there's no direct function to correct based on the given information. However, if fixing a hypothetical vulnerability related to locked funds in the contract "Upgradeable," ensure there's a secure way to transfer or withdraw funds. The below example adds a withdraw function to the Upgradeable contract for demonstration purposes.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Existing initialize function
    function initialize(address sender) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry));
    }

    // Hypothetical function to address locked funds issue - allowing withdrawal by a specific role or under specific conditions
    function withdraw(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        // Add your own access control mechanism
        require(msg.sender == /* address with withdrawal permission */, "Unauthorized");
        require(address(this).balance >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        _to.transfer(_amount);
    }
}
