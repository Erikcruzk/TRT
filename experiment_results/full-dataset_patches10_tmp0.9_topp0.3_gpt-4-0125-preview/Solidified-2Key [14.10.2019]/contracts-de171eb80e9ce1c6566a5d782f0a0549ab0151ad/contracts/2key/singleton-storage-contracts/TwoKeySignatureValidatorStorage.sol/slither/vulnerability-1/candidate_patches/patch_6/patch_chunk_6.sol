// The provided code does not include a specific function called `beginMigration()`. 
// Therefore, I'll address the mentioned vulnerability regarding the uninitialized state variable `_implementation`.

// To fix the uninitialized-state vulnerability for `_implementation`, you should ensure it is properly initialized. 
// However, without a specific context or function like `beginMigration()` to fix, I will demonstrate a generic way 
// to initialize `_implementation` within the contract. This approach involves creating a constructor or an initializer function.
