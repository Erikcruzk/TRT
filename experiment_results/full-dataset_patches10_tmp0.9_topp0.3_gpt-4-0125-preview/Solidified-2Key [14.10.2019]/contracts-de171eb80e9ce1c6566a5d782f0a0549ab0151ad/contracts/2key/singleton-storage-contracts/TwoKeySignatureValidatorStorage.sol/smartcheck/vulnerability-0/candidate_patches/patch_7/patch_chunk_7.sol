// This contract does not contain a specific function named `beginMigration()`. 
// However, based on the provided context and the known vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) within the Upgradeable contract, 
// it seems the issue is related to the ability (or lack thereof) to withdraw or transfer funds from the contract, potentially leading to locked funds.
// Below is a suggested generic implementation to safely withdraw funds from a contract to address the locked money issue. 
// Note: This function should be carefully integrated and permissions set appropriately to prevent unauthorized access.
