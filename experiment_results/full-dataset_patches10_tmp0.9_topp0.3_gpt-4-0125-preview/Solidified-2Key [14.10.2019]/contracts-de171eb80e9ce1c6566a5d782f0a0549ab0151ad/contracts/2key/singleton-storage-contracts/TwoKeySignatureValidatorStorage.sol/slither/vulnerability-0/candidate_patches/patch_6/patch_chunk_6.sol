// There is no specific beginMigration function provided in the supplied code.
// However, based on the vulnerability reported (uninitialized-state in ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;),
// a potential issue fix could involve ensuring the state variable is properly initialized in the constructor or a specific initializer function.
// Since no such constructor or initializer is directly provided in your context, below is a generic example of how it could be addressed:

// Assuming an initializer function for UpgradeabilityStorage to properly initialize the `registry` state variable:

function initializeRegistry(address registryAddress) public {
    require(address(registry) == address(0), "Registry already initialized.");
    registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(registryAddress);
}
