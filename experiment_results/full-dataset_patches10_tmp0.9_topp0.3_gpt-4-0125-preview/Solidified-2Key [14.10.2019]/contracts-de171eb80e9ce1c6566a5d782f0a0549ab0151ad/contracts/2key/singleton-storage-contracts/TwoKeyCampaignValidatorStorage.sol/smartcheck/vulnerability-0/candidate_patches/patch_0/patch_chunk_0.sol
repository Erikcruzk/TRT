// There's no function named beginMigration provided in the given contract code.
// However, to address the general concern of SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY, typically you would ensure that the contract:
// 1. Has a way to transfer out any Ether it receives (if it's supposed to hold Ether)
// 2. Doesn't unnecessarily restrict receiving Ether if it does not need to hold Ether, by not implementing a payable fallback function or by ensuring mechanisms for Ether withdrawal.

// Since the provided code does not directly relate to handling or locking money (Ether) in the contracts and does not contain a beginMigration function,
// it is not possible to provide a corrected version of beginMigration or directly address the vulnerability without more context about the intended functionality.

// An example pattern to safely withdraw funds (general example, not directly from the provided code):
/*
function withdraw() public {
    address payable recipient = msg.sender;
    uint amount = balances[recipient];
    require(amount > 0, "Withdrawal amount must be greater than zero");
    balances[recipient] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Failed to send Ether");
}
*/

// Please provide the code for the specific function or more details on intended money handling if the solution is not related to the provided information.
