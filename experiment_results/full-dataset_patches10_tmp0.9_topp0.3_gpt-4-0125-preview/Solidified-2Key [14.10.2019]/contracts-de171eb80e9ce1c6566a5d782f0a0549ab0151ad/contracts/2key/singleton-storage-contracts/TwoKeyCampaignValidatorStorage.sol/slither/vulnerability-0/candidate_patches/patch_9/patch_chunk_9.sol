// The provided code does not include a function named beginMigration().
// However, to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability found by the analyzer,
// ensure all state variables are properly initialized in the contract's constructor or initialization function.
// As an example for how to initialize the registry in a contract, see below:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract ExampleContract {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    constructor(address _registryAddress) public {
        registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(_registryAddress);
    }

    // Other functions and contract logic...
}
