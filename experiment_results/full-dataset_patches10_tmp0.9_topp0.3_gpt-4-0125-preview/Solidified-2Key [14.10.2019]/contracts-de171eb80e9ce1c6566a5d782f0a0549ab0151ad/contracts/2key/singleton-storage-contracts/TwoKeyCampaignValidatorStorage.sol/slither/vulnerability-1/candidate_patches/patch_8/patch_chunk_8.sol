// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function as described. However, to address the identified vulnerability:
// The uninitialized-state vulnerability related to the `_implementation` address in the UpgradeabilityStorage contract.
// To ensure the contract is securely initialized, consider adding an initialization function that sets the `_implementation` address.
