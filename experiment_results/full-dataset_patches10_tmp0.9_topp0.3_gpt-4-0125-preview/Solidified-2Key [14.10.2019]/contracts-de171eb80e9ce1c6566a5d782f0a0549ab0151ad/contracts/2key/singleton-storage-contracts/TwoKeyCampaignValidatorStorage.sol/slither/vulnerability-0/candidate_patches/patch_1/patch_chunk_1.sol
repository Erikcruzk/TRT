// This provided code does not contain a specific function named `beginMigration()` to be fixed. 
// However, the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned refers to the `registry` state variable not being initialized. 
// To mitigate the vulnerability, you would typically initialize your state variables within a constructor or an initialization function. 
// Since the provided code does not specify where or how `registry` should be initialized, a generic solution is to provide an initialization function for the contract that includes it.
