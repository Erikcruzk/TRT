// This code snippet is not applicable as the reported vulnerability is related to an uninitialized state variable,
// and there is no specific function provided in the given code that directly relates to initializing the `registry` state variable.
// Therefore, no Solidity code for a specific function can be provided to directly fix the reported issue.

// However, to address the uninitialized-state issue for `registry` in UpgradeabilityStorage,
// ensure that `registry` is properly initialized in the contract's constructor or an initialization function.
