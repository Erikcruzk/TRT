// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(). However, based on the given task, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or a mistake in the task description. Below is a clarification regarding the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned:

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    // This was identified as a vulnerability due to it being uninitialized in the provided code.
    // To address the uninitialized-state vulnerability, ensure _implementation is properly initialized in the contract's constructor or setup function.
    address internal _implementation;

    // Assuming a setup or constructor function for demonstrative purposes:
    constructor(address initialImplementation) public {
        _implementation = initialImplementation;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
