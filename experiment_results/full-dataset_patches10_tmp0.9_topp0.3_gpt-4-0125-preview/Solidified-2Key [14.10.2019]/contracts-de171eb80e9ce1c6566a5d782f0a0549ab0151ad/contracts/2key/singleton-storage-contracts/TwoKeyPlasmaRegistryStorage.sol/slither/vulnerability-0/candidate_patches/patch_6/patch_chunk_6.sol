// The uninitialized-state vulnerability flagged originates from the ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry not being initialized within UpgradeabilityStorage or its derivatives.
// The vulnerability can be mitigated by ensuring `registry` is properly initialized before being used. This requires changes outside a specific function to resolve fully.
// However, as per the instructions, only the Solidity code of the specific function or related contract modification can be provided, without natural language explanations.
// Since the `beginMigration` function is not provided in the code snippet, and based on the request, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or typo in the query.
// Assuming the task is to demonstrate how to initialize or interact with `registry` safely, the following generalized approach is illustrated without a specific `beginMigration` function:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Added constructor to properly initialize registry
    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        require(address(_registry) != address(0), "Registry address cannot be 0.");
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
