// This contract does not contain a function explicitly named `beginMigration`. Based on the description and the contracts provided,
// it seems there might be a confusion or mislabeling in the request. Given the context and the identified vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// there's no direct reference to a specific function to fix under that name. However, improvements or fixes would typically involve
// ensuring that contracts handling funds have mechanisms to transfer those funds appropriately, often through functions designed
// to withdraw or migrate funds securely. Without a specific function named `beginMigration` provided in the user's input, a direct
// repair cannot be applied. Please provide the correct function name or more details for a precise fix.
