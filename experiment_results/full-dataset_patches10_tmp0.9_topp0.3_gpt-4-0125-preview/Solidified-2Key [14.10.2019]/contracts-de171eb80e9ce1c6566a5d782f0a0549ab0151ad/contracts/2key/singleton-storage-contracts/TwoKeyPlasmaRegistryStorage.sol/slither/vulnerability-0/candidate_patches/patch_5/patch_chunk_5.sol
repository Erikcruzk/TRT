// This is not a direct solution as the provided code does not include a beginMigration() function.
// However, based on the vulnerability indicated (uninitialized-state in ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry),
// a potential solution to show how to properly initialize such a state variable in a constructor or an initialization function might look like:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Assuming a constructor or an initialization function is missing where registry should be initialized
    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
