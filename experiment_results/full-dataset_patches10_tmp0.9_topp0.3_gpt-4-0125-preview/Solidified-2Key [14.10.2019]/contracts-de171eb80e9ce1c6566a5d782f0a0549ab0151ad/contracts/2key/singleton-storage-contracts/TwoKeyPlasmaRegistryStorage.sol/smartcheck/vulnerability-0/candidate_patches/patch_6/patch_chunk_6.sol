// The provided code does not include a specific beginMigration() function to correct. 
// Therefore, I'm providing a hypothetical secure implementation for a beginMigration function in Solidity, 
// considering the general context and the reported vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY). 
// This includes proper access control and ensuring only authorized entities can invoke migration, 
// thus preventing unauthorized locking of funds in the contract.
