// This contract code does not directly contain a beginMigration() function or an explicitly vulnerable function based on the provided smartcheck analysis result.
// However, the report suggests an issue with locked funds in Upgradeable contracts, but no specific function to address this is provided in the given code.
// Since the user asks for the beginMigration() function to fix a vulnerability and such a function is not present,
// below is a hypothetical implementation of beginMigration() added to the Upgradeable contract to demonstrate how one might handle upgrades with such a pattern in Solidity,
// assuming the task is to safely upgrade to a new contract version without locking funds.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Existing functions...

    // Hypothetical function to illustrate how a migration could be started safely.
    // Note: This is an example and assumes the existence of a function in the registry to set a new implementation.
    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Only allowed by registry");
        _implementation = newImplementation; // Update the pointer to the new contract implementation
        // Additional steps might be required in practice, e.g., initializing the new implementation or ensuring no funds are locked.
