// This contract does not directly contain a beginMigration() function or an explicit vulnerability related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY.
// However, the provided code does not exhibit a clear vulnerability related to locked funds as described. 
// Users are advised to ensure that contracts managing funds have appropriate withdrawal mechanisms and are upgradeable 
// if the intention is to prevent locking funds permanently. This might involve implementing functions that allow 
// for the withdrawal of funds or the migration of state to a new contract version, respecting the principles of 
// secure contract upgradeability.

// Below is a hypothetical example of how a `beginMigration` function might look if the objective is to ensure 
// the contract can be upgraded or funds can be migrated securely. This function should be part of a contract 
// that is designed to be upgradeable or has fund management features.

// Note: This is a conceptual example and might not directly apply to the contracts you've provided.
// Ensure to adapt the logic to fit your specific contract's architecture and security requirements.
