// The code provided does not explicitly include a beginMigration function to address the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability.
// An illustrative fix would involve implementing safety checks, access controls, or mechanisms to prevent locking funds unintentionally.
// However, since the specific function beginMigration was not provided, here's a general template on how it could be securely structured:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Example function to safely begin migration, preventing locked funds
    function beginMigration(address newAddress) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized");
        // Additional checks or operations to ensure funds are not locked during migration
        _implementation = newAddress;
    }
}
