// There's no specific function called beginMigration() or a direct mention of a function containing the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability within the provided code. 
// Given the context, if the concern is about locking money in the contract without a way to retrieve it, 
// the following is a generic example function that could be added to any of the contracts (e.g., Upgradeable or StructuredStorage) 
// to allow withdrawal of funds by a designated owner or deployer, addressing potential locked money issues:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable { // This could be any of the provided contracts. This example adds the function to Upgradeable for illustration.
    address private owner;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender; // Sets the contract deployer as the owner.
    }

    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    // Example function to address locked funds issue.
    function withdraw(uint amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        owner.transfer(amount);
    }

    // Include other functions and state variables from the provided contract code as necessary.
