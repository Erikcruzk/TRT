// This is the corrected version of the vulnerable function definition.
// Given that the vulnerability highlighted is SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY, and 
// the provided code does not directly show where funds could be unintentionally locked,
// a common preventive approach is to make sure contracts have a way to transfer out ether.

// However, since no specific function related to handling ether was provided,
// nor was there a detailed description of where the locked funds issue occurs,
// below is a generic fallback function to safely transfer out ether, assuming it might help:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Adding a fallback function to accept Ether transactions
    function() public payable {
    }

    // Function to withdraw Ether from the contract, to prevent LOCKED_MONEY issue.
    // This function can be restricted to the owner or a specific role depending on your security model.
    function withdrawEther(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {
        require(_to != address(0));
        require(_amount <= address(this).balance);
        _to.transfer(_amount);
    }

    function initialize(address sender) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry));
    }
}
