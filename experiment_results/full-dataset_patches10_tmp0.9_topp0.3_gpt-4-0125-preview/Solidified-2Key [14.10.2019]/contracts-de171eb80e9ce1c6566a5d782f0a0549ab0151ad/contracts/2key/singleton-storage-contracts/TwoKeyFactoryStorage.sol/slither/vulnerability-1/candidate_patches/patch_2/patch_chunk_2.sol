// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), and the provided analysis and code snippet do not mention or define such a function.
// However, to address the uninitialized state variable vulnerability mentioned, we can initialize the _implementation variable in the constructor or an initialization function if applicable.
// Since no specific function was requested for fixing except the mentioned vulnerability, below is an illustrative example of how to properly initialize the _implementation variable in a hypothetical initialization function:

// Example initialization function to fix the uninitialized state variable '_implementation'
// Add this to the UpgradeabilityStorage contract or a relevant contract where _implementation should be initialized

function initializeImplementation(address newImplementation) public {
    require(_implementation == address(0), "Implementation already initialized.");
    _implementation = newImplementation;
}
