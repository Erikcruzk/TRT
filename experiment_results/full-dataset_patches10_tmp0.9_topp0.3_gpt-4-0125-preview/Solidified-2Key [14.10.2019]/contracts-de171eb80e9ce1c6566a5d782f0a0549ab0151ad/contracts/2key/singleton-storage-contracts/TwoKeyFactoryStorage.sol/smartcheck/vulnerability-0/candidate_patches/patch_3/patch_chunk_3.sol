// This Solidity snippet does not directly correspond to the vulnerability identified.
// The provided code does not include a `beginMigration` function or an explicit lock mechanism.
// However, to address concerns about locked funds (a common issue in upgradeable contracts),
// a potential safeguard mechanism could involve adding a withdraw function to manage funds.

// Example safeguard function to prevent locked funds in upgradeable contracts.
// Note: This is a conceptual example and may not directly apply to the provided contract structure.

function withdraw(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    recipient.transfer(amount);
