// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or an explicit vulnerability within a single function based on the provided code and the description of the vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY).
// However, to address a potential vulnerability related to locked funds in a contract that doesn't have a withdraw functionality, you can add a safe withdraw function to the Upgradeable contract as an example of mitigating such a concern:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Existing functions

    // Function to mitigate potential locked funds issue
    // Ensure to adjust access control as per your contract's requirements
    function withdraw(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Adjust based on your access control requirements
        require(_to != address(0));
        require(_amount <= address(this).balance);

        _to.transfer(_amount);
    }
}
