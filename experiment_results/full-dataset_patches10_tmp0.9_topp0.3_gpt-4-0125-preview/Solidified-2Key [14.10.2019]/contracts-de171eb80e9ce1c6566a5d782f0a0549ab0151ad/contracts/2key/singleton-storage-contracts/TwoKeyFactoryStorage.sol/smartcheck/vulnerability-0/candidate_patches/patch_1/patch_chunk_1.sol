// This code section does not directly contain a specific function named `beginMigration`.
// However, the referenced vulnerability might relate to the pattern of handling upgradeability and initialization within these contracts.
// Given the context and the structure of provided contracts, there's no explicit `beginMigration` function presented.
// For repair purposes and addressing upgradeability concerns, a conceptual `beginMigration` function is provided below as an example fix:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    bool private inMigration;

    // This is a conceptual example function based on the provided context.
    function beginMigration() public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized");
        require(!inMigration, "Migration already in progress");
        inMigration = true;
        // Additional migration logic here
    }

    // Example function to finalize the migration, not originally provided but conceptually necessary.
    function endMigration() public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized");
        require(inMigration, "Migration not in progress");
        inMigration = false;
        // Additional logic to finalize the migration
    }
}
