// The provided code does not include a specific implementation for a function named `beginMigration`. 
// However, to address the general concern of locked funds in contracts (as highlighted by the vulnerability notice),
// a generic solution would be to include a withdraw function that allows the contract owner or a specific role
// to withdraw funds. This ensures that funds are not inadvertently locked within the contract. Below is an example
// implementation assuming the contract should include such functionality.

// This function should be added to a contract that needs to handle potential locked funds,
// ensuring there's a mechanism for withdrawing those funds.

// Example implementation:

function withdraw(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    recipient.transfer(amount);
}

// Note: Make sure to properly define and implement the `onlyOwner` modifier based on your contract's requirements.
// This modifier typically checks if the message sender is the owner of the contract and reverts the transaction if not.
// Also, the `withdraw` function should be carefully protected and only accessible by authorized entities to prevent unauthorized fund access.
