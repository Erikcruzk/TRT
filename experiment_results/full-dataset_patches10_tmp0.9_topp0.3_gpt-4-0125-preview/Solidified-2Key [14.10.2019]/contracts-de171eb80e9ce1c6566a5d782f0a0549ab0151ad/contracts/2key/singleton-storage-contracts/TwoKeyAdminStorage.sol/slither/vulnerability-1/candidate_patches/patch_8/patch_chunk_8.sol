// This Solidity code snippet does not directly correspond to any function that requires repair based on the provided analysis and context.
// The reported vulnerability is about an uninitialized state variable, and there's no specific function like beginMigration() mentioned in the query.
// However, to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability pointed out by the slither analysis, consider initializing the _implementation variable in the constructor or through an initializer function for UpgradeabilityStorage or any relevant contract.

// Example of addressing the vulnerability by adding an initializer function in UpgradeabilityStorage:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    address internal _implementation;

    function initializeImplementation(address implementationAddress) public {
        require(_implementation == address(0), "Already initialized.");
        _implementation = implementationAddress;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
