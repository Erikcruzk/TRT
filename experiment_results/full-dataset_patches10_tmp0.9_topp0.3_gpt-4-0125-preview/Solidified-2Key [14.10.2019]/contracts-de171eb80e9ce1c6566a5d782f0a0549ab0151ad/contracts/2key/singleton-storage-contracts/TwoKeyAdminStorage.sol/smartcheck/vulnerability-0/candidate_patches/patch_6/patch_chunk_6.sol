// This contract and function does not appear directly in the provided source code.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Function to safely begin migration, ensuring only authorized users can trigger it
    // and no funds are locked unintentionally. Details of the migration process are hypothetical
    // as the original code context is not provided.
