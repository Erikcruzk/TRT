// This is not a direct fix because the original request did not contain a specific function named beginMigration().
// However, to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability in UpgradeabilityStorage, you can initialize the registry in a constructor or an initializer function.
// Here's an example of how you might modify the UpgradeabilityStorage contract to include initialization of the registry:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Added constructor to initialize the registry
    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        require(address(_registry) != address(0), "Registry address cannot be 0.");
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
