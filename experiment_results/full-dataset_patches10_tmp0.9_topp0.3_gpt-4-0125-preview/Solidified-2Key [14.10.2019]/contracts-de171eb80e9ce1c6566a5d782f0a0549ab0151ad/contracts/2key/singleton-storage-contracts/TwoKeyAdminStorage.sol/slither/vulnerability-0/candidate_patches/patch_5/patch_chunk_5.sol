// This code is not present in the provided contract source code, so a direct implementation change or fix cannot be provided based on the context given. 
// However, since the uninitialized-state vulnerability was reported in relation to the `ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;`, 
// a common way to address such vulnerabilities is to ensure that all state variables are properly initialized. 
// Since no specific function to initialize the `registry` variable was provided in the code snippets, 
// a hypothetical fix could involve adding an initialization function or ensuring it's initialized in the constructor (not visible in the provided code).

// Hypothetical constructor added to UpgradeabilityStorage to ensure `registry` is initialized:
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Assuming a constructor that takes the address of the registry to initialize the state variable.
    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}

// Note: The constructor approach may not directly apply if `UpgradeabilityStorage` is meant to be used as a base contract for proxy pattern implementation.
// An alternative approach might involve explicitly initializing the `registry` through an `initialize` method, which must be carefully protected against re-initialization in the upgradeable contract pattern.
