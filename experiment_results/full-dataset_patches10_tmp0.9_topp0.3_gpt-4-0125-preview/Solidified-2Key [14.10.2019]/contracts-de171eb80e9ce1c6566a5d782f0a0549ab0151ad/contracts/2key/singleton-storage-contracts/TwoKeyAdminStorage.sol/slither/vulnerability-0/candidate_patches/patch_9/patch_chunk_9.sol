// There is no specific function named "beginMigration" provided in the provided source code.
// Reviewing the provided code, it seems like the main concern is the uninitialized state variable `registry` in `UpgradeabilityStorage`.
// To address the uninitialized state vulnerability, a setter function for `registry` should be added in a relevant contract.
// Since no specific function or further context was given related to `beginMigration()`, I'll provide a solution to initialize the `registry` variable safely.

    address internal _implementation;

    // Existing function
    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }

    // Setter function to safely initialize the `registry` variable
    function setRegistry(address _registryAddress) external {
        // Additional checks can be added here (such as onlyOwner modifier) to ensure that only authorized entities can call this function

// Note: This code snippet is intended to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability by providing a method to initialize the `registry`.
// Depending on the contract system's design, further adjustments may be necessary, including access control (e.g., using `Ownable` pattern for restricting who can call `setRegistry`).
