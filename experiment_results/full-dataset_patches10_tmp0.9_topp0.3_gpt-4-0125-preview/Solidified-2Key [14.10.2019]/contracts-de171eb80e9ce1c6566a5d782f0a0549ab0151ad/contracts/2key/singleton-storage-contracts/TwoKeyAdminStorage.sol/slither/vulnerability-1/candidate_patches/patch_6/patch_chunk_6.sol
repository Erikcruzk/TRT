// This function is not directly provided in the given code. Assuming the vulnerability resides within the provided contracts and 
// referring to the upgrade mechanism which involves "_implementation", a safe initialization pattern would involve ensuring 
// "_implementation" is set upon contract creation or through a controlled manner.

// Since no specific function named `beginMigration` is provided within the shared code, 
// below is an illustrative approach to securely set the `_implementation` address in an upgradeable contract setting.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    event ImplementationChanged(address newImplementation);

    // Only allow the registry to call this function to ensure control over the upgrade process
    function changeImplementation(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized");
        require(newImplementation != address(0), "Invalid address");
        _implementation = newImplementation;
        emit ImplementationChanged(newImplementation);

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}

// Note: Actual implementation of `beginMigration` would depend on the specific migration logic required.
// For example, changing the implementation address, initializing new storage variables, etc.
// The given function `changeImplementation` provides a controlled way to update the implementation address used by a proxy contract.
