// This is not a direct fix because the vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) is not directly
// associated with a specific function in the given code. It's generally related to the contract's inability
// to transfer or withdraw Ether. However, given the context, there's no function here dealing with
// Ether transactions directly. For demonstration, I'll add a withdraw function to `Upgradeable`
// contract to mitigate potential locked funds issue.
