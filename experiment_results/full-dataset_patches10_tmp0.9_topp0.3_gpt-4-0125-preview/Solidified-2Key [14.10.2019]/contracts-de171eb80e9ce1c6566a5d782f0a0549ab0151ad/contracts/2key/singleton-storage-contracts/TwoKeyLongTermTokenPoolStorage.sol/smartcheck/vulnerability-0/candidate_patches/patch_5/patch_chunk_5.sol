// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any explicit vulnerabilities related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY in the provided code. 
// The provided code does not include a function or context explicitly named "beginMigration", nor does it contain operations 
// that would inherently lock funds without a means of retrieval based on the given snippets.

// Given the task's constraints and the provided snippets, it's not possible to directly address the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability 
// without more context or the specific function in question. 

// If "beginMigration" or related context was intended to be addressed, it appears to be missing from the provided snippets.
