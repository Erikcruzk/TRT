// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerability related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY. 
// However, ensuring no locked funds can be a part of good practice in contract design, typically by providing withdrawal mechanisms or similar.
// Given the instructions, no specific function can be provided as there's no beginMigration() or related context in the provided code.
