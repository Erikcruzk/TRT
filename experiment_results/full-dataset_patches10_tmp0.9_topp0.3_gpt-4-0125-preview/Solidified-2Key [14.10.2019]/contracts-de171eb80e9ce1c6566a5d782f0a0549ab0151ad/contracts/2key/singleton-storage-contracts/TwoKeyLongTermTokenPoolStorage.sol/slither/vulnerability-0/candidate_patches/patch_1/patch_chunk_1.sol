// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or an explicit vulnerability associated directly with a function.

// For completeness, here is a generic example of how one might initialize the 'registry' in a constructor or initialization function 
// to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability, assuming a function or constructor is where it's needed.
