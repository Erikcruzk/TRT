// This code snippet is not directly vulnerable but is part of the contract setup.
// The vulnerability mentioned relates to the uninitialized state variable "_implementation".
// There's no specific function provided to address this exact issue,
// but initializing the "_implementation" variable is crucial for security and functionality.

// Assuming the task is to create or modify a function to safely begin a migration process
// that might include initializing or updating the `_implementation` address,
// here is an example solution considering best practices:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Existing functions and state variables...

    // Function to safely set the implementation address
    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Only registry can update the implementation");
        require(newImplementation != address(0), "Invalid address for new implementation");
        _implementation = newImplementation;
    }
}

// Note: Modifications may be needed based on the overall contract architecture
// and how `_implementation` is expected to be used or updated.
