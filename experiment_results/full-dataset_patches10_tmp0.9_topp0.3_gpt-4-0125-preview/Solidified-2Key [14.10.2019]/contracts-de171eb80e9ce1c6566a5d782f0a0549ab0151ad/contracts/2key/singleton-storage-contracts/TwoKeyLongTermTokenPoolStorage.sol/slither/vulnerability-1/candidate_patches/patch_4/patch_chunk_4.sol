// No specific function is vulnerable or pointed out in the provided details.
// However, the issue highlighted is regarding the uninitialized state variable `_implementation`.
// In Solidity, constructors can be used to initialize state variables when a contract is deployed.
// Given the context, ensuring `_implementation` is initialized properly would require setting its value
// at deployment. Since direct modification to `_implementation` is not shown, a generic approach is provided below.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Assuming a constructor or an initialization function is the right place
    // to address the uninitialized state variable issue.
    function initializeImplementation(address implementationAddress) public {
        // Additional conditions, like ownership or similar, should be considered here to secure this call.
        _implementation = implementationAddress;
    }
