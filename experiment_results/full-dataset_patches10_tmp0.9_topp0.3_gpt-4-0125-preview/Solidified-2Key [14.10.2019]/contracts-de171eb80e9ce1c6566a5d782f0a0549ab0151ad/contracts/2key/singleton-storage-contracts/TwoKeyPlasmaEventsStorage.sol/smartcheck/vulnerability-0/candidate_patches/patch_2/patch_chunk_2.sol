// The provided code does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(). 
// Given the context and the nature of the vulnerability hint (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY), 
// there seems to be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the code related to such a function.

// Assuming the task is to address a general vulnerability related to locked money 
// in contracts that inherit from UpgradeabilityStorage or similar structures,
// hereâ€™s a hypothetical improvement for a function that might be related to upgrading a contract
// which could lead to locked funds if not handled properly:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    // Hypothetical function to safely begin migration to a new contract implementation
    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Only the registry can initiate migration.");
        require(newImplementation != address(0), "New implementation cannot be the zero address.");
        _implementation = newImplementation;
        // Additional events or logic to transition state or notify of change can be added here
    }
}
