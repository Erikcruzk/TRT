// This contract does not have a beginMigration() function or a directly related vulnerability 
// based on the provided context and analysis results. However, to address the general concern of 
// locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY), ensuring that the contract can manage and release funds 
// properly is crucial. Since there's no specific function provided in the context for handling funds, 
// a hypothetical solution could involve implementing a withdraw function to prevent locked funds.

// Assuming the intention was to manage funds safely in the contract structure provided, here is an example:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Function to safely withdraw funds to the owner or a specific address
    // This function is not originally part of the provided code
    // It's an illustrative example to address the general concern of locked funds

    address private owner;

    function beginMigration() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can initiate migration");
        // Logic to begin migration...
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
        require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        owner.transfer(amount);
    }

    // Constructor to set the owner
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
