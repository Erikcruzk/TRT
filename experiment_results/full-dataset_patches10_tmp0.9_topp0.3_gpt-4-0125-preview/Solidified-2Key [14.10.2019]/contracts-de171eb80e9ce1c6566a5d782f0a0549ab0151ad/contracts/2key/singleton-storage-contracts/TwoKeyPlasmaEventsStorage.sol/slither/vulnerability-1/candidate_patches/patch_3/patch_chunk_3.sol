// There is no specific function named "beginMigration" in the provided contract code.
// However, to address the vulnerability related to the uninitialized state variable `_implementation`,
// It is advised to properly initialize the `_implementation` variable either in the constructor or through a setter function.
// Below is an example of how to initialize `_implementation` in a safe manner:

// Assuming a setter function is the preferred method for initializing `_implementation`:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Existing code
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Existing implementation() function
    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }

    // Setter function to safely initialize `_implementation` variable
    function setImplementation(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized");
        require(newImplementation != address(0), "Invalid address");
        _implementation = newImplementation;
    }
}

// Note: You must ensure the `setImplementation` function can only be called by authorized addresses
// to maintain the integrity and security of the smart contract.
