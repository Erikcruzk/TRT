// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), 
// and the information provided does not specify a vulnerable function related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY directly.
// However, based on the context provided and the typical concerns around locked funds in upgradeable contracts,
// there might be a misunderstanding or need for a function to mitigate such concerns. Hence, providing a generic solution: 

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    function beginMigration() external {
        // Assuming the intention is to allow the owner or a specific role to begin a migration process
        // This should be secured with the appropriate access control checks (not shown here)
        // Place your logic for the migration process, such as transferring funds or changing state to prepare for migration.
        // For example, you might want to ensure that the contract can no longer accept deposits or that ownership is transferred.
