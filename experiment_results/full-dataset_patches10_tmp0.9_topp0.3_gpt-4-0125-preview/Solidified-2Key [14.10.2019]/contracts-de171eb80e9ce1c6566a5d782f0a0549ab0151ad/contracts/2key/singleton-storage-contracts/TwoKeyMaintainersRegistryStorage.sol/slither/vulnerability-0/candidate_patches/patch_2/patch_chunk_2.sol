// The vulnerable function or contract is not specifically mentioned in the provided code.
// However, addressing the uninitialized-state vulnerability in the UpgradeabilityStorage contract
// would involve initializing the `registry` variable. Since there is no given context or functionality
// to initialize it within the provided code, one exemplary approach to mitigate such an issue would
// be to add a constructor or an initialization function to explicitly set the registry. This example
// assumes adding such functionality directly is appropriate based on the provided code context.
