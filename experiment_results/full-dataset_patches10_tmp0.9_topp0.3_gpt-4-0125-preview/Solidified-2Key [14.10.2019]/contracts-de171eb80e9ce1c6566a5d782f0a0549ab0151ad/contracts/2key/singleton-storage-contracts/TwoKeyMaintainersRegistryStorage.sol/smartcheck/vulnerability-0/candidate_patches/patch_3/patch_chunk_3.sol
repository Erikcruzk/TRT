// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(). 
// Therefore, an attempt to make the Upgradeable contract safer based on the provided information is presented below:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    function initialize(address sender) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry));
        // Ensure the contract can only be initialized once
        require(_implementation == address(0), "Contract is already initialized.");
        _implementation = sender; // Assuming you want to set the sender as the implementation for some reason
        // Additional initialization logic can be added here

        // Make sure to properly manage or mitigate any locking of funds in the contract
        // And ensure there's functionality to withdraw or upgrade the contract as needed
    }
