// There is no specific function named "beginMigration" in the provided code. 
// However, the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned refers to the ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry declaration.
// To mitigate this, ensure proper initialization of the registry variable, which should be done in the constructor or an initialization function.
// Since there's no direct function to fix based on the given description and code, below is an illustrative example of how to properly initialize such a variable in a contract:

contract ExampleInitialization {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        registry = _registry;
    }
}
