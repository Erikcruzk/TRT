// No specific function is provided for modification. The reported vulnerability is related to an uninitialized state variable in the contract. 
// To address the uninitialized-state vulnerability found by the analysis, we should ensure that the `registry` variable is properly initialized. 
// Since there's no specific function to modify based on the provided code and request, a proper initialization technique would involve 
// setting the `registry` variable, perhaps during contract deployment or through an initialization function if appropriate for the contract's design. 

// Since the actual initialization depends heavily on the design context which isn't provided, below is an illustrative example of how one might modify 
// an initialization function to set the `registry` variable if such a function were to be identified or added for fixing the vulnerability:

function initializeRegistry(address _registryAddress) public {
    // Additional checks can be added here to ensure that this function is called by authorized personnel or under correct conditions
    require(address(registry) == address(0), "Registry already initialized.");
    registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(_registryAddress);
