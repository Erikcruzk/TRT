// There is no specific function named "beginMigration" provided in the given contract code. The vulnerability noted, SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY, 
// suggests an issue with contracts potentially locking funds without a way to withdraw them. However, the provided code does not include
// a function that handles funds directly in a manner that could lock them. The closest context we have related to upgrades (migration) 
// and handling funds is in the `initialize` function within the `Upgradeable` contract, which is designed for initializing contracts in 
// an upgradeable pattern. Here's an improvement on the `Upgradeable` contract, ensuring there's no explicit function named `beginMigration` 
// based on the provided context. If there's a specific function or scenario you're referring to for migration or handling funds, 
// please specify.

        // Ensure any funds sent to this function are handled safely or refunded if not used.
        // Implementing a safe migration strategy or fund management mechanism would depend on the contract's specific needs.
