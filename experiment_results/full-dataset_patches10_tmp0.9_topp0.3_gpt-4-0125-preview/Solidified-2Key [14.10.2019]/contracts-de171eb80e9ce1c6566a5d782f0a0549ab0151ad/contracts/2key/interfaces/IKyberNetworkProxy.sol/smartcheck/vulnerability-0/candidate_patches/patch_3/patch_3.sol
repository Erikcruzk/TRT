// This contract does not contain a specific function named `beginMigration` or any other function directly.
// Since the instruction was to provide the code for a function named `beginMigration` which fixes a vulnerability,
// but no such function exists in the provided code, it's not possible to fulfill this request accurately.
// The provided code does not show a direct vulnerability related to locked money in contracts without a means to withdraw them.
// However, to address a common pattern that could lead to locked funds (not directly visible in the snippet provided),
// ensuring there's a way to recover funds is crucial in smart contracts. Below is an illustrative example of how one might
// add a function to safely withdraw funds if such functionality was missing and could lead to locked funds:

// Example addition to a contract to prevent locked funds (not directly fixing `beginMigration` as no such function is provided):
