// This contract does not contain a specific function named `beginMigration()`, nor does it present a direct functionality or pattern that involves locking funds in a manner that can be easily fixed or pinpointed in a single function based on the provided details. The provided code is an interface and basic token implementations without direct implementation details that would typically contain a migration logic or a vulnerability related to locked funds.

// For a hypothetical `beginMigration()` function in a contract that interacts with IKyberNetworkProxy or handles ERC20 tokens, ensuring no locked funds would involve making sure that all funds (ETH or tokens) can be withdrawn or moved. However, without specific implementation details, creating a fixed version of a non-existent `beginMigration()` function is not feasible.

// Ensure all funds are accessible and can be moved to prevent locked funds without a specific function to address.
