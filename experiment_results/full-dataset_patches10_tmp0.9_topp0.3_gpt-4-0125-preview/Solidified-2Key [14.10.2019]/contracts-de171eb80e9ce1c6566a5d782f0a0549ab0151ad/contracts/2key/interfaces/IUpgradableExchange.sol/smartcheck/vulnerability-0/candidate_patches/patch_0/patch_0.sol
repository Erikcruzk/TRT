pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

// Since the provided contract interface IUpgradableExchange does not include a beginMigration() function,
// and based on the request, it seems there's a misunderstanding or missing context about the specific function to fix.
// However, addressing the usual pattern for a migration function and aiming to avoid locking funds, a generic safe example might look something like this:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract ExampleContract {
    address public owner;
    bool public migrationStarted;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        migrationStarted = false;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    function beginMigration() public onlyOwner {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration already started");

        migrationStarted = true;
    }
}
