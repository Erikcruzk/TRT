// This contract does not contain a specific function that locks funds inherently by its definition;
// it only defines interfaces without implementations. Thus, there's no specific function code to correct for SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY.
// If the problem relates to a missing functionality for fund withdrawal or similar,
// you might be asking about implementation details not provided in the interface above.
