// This contract does not contain the function beginMigration(), nor does it have any direct vulnerabilities related to locked money as it does not hold or manage ether itself.
// However, functions that might be related to the issue (due to external calls potentially causing locked funds) are already provided above.
// If the function beginMigration() was part of another contract not provided here, please provide the specific contract code including that function for further assistance.
