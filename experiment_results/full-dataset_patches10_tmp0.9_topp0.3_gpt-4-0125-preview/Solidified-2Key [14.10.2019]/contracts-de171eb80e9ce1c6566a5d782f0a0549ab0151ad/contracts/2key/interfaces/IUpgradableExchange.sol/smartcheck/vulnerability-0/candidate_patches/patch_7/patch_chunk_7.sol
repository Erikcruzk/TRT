// This contract does not contain the identified vulnerability directly in its functions as it is an interface.
// The vulnerability might arise in its implementations where the actual logic is defined.
// There's no `beginMigration()` function or any other function's implementation in this provided contract interface.

// Since the user requested the `beginMigration()` function specifically but it is not part of the provided contract interface, 
// it's impossible to provide a fixed version of it based on the given source code.
