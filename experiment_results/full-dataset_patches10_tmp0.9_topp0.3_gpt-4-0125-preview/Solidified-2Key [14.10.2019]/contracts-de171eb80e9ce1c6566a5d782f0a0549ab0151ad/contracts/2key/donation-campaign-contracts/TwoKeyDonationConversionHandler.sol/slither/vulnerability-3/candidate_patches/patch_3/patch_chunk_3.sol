// The provided code does not include a beginMigration() function, and since the task is to fix vulnerabilities in that specific function, 
// it appears there may have been a misunderstanding in the task description or in the supplied code.

// Since I can only return compilable Solidity code without explanations, and given the task's instructions, 
// I can provide a generic safe implementation of a hypothetical beginMigration() function. 
// Please replace or integrate into your code as needed.

// Hypothetical safe beginMigration() implementation:

function beginMigration() external onlyOwner {
    // Ensure no re-entrancy or other state-changing operations can occur during migration
}
