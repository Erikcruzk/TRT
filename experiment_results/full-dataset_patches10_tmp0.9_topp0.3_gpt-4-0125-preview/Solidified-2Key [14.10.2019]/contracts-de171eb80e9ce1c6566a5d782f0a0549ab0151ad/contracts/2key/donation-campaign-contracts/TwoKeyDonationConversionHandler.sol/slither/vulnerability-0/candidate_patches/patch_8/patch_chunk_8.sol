    // Intentionally left empty to demonstrate a fix for an uninitialized state vulnerability,
    // which would typically involve ensuring the mapping is correctly initialized or managed.
    // Since the provided code does not include a specific logic error within `beginMigration`, 
    // and the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned does not directly apply to a specific function's logic,
    // further context or code would be required to provide a meaningful fix.
