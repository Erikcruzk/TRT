// This function was not provided in the given code, thus a generic fix for the reentrancy vulnerability will not target a specific function. 
// Instead, I will provide a template for a function that could potentially suffer from reentrancy and show how to make it resilient to such attacks.

// Assuming the function beginMigration() could potentially transfer Ether and might be vulnerable to reentrancy, here's an example of how it could be made safer:

function beginMigration() external {
    // Assuming there's a mapping to track whether a migration for a user has started
    // mapping(address => bool) private migrationStarted;

    require(!migrationStarted[msg.sender], "Migration already started for this address");

    // Mark migration as started for this sender to prevent re-entry
    migrationStarted[msg.sender] = true;

    // Add the rest of the migration logic here

    // After the logic is safely executed, you can reset the migration if needed
    // migrationStarted[msg.sender] = false;
}

// Note: This is a template function. The actual implementation details could vary based on the specific requirements and context of the beginMigration() function.
