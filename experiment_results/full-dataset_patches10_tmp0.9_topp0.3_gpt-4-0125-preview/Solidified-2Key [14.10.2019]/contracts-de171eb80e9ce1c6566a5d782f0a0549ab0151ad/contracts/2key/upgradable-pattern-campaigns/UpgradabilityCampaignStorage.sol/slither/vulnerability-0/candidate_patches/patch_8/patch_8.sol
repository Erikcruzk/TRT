// This contract does not contain a function called beginMigration() or any other functions.
// The provided code snippet shows parts of a contract, focusing on storage variables and an interface definition.
// To address the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned for the variable _implementation, a direct fix to this issue cannot be applied without seeing the usage context or functions like beginMigration().
// Please provide the function that needs to be fixed or further details on how _implementation is intended to be used within the contract.
