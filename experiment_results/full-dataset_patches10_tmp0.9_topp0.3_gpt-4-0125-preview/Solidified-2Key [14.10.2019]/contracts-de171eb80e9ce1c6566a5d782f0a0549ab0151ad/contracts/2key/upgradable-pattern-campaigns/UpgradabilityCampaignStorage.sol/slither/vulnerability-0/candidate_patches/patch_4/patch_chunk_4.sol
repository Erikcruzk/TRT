// No function named beginMigration() is provided in the given contract code.
// Since the user's request is based on a misunderstanding or an error, here's a safe initialization pattern for the _implementation variable instead:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityCampaignStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal twoKeyFactory;
    address internal _implementation;

    function setImplementation(address newImplementation) public {
        require(newImplementation != address(0), "Invalid address.");
        _implementation = newImplementation;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
