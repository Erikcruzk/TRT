// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function and no explicit
// vulnerabilities related to uninitialized-state in the provided code snippet.
// However, to address potential concerns about the uninitialized _implementation address,
// here's how you might explicitly initialize it in a constructor or a setter function,
// assuming such an approach fits the contract's design:
