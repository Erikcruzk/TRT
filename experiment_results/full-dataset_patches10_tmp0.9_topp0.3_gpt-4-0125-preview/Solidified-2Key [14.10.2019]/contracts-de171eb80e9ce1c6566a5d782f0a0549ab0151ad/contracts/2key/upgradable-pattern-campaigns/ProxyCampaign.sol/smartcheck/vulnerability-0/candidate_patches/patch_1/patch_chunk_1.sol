// No specific function named beginMigration() is provided in the provided contract code.
// However, addressing the potential issue related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY in the Proxy contract.
// The provided Proxy contract does not directly contain a vulnerability related to locked funds,
// as it forwards all calls (including Ether) to its implementation. 
// If the implementation contract does not correctly handle Ether transfers, then funds could indeed get locked.
// Since no explicit beginMigration() function exists and modifications to address SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY
// would typically involve ensuring that the contract can handle or reject direct Ether transfers appropriately,
// here is an improved version of the Proxy's fallback function to explicitly reject Ether transfers:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Proxy {

    function implementation() public view returns (address);

    function () payable public {
        // Reject direct Ether transfers
        require(msg.value == 0, "Direct Ether transfers are prohibited.");
        
        address _impl = implementation();
        require(_impl != address(0));

        assembly {
            let ptr := mload(0x40)
            calldatacopy(ptr, 0, calldatasize)
            let result := delegatecall(gas, _impl, ptr, calldatasize, 0, 0)
            let size := returndatasize
            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)

            switch result
            case 0 { revert(ptr, size) }
