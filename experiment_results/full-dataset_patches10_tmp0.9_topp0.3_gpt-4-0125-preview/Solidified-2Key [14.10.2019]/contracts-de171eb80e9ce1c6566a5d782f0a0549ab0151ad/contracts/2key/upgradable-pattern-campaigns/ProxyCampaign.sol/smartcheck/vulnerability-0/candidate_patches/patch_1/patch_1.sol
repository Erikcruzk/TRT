// No specific function named beginMigration() is provided in the provided contract code.
// However, addressing the potential issue related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY in the Proxy contract.
// The provided Proxy contract does not directly contain a vulnerability related to locked funds,
// as it forwards all calls (including Ether) to its implementation. 
// If the implementation contract does not correctly handle Ether transfers, then funds could indeed get locked.
// Since no explicit beginMigration() function exists and modifications to address SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY
// would typically involve ensuring that the contract can handle or reject direct Ether transfers appropriately,
// here is an improved version of the Proxy's fallback function to explicitly reject Ether transfers:
