// There is no explicit function named "beginMigration()" within the provided code.
// The provided code does not contain a direct issue related to "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY", as the warning might suggest issues with funds being locked in a contract unintentionally.
// Since a specific fix cannot be applied without a clear identification of the function or scenario causing the "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" vulnerability,
// it's important to ensure that contracts handling funds have mechanisms to transfer those funds appropriately, which might include functions to withdraw or migrate funds safely.
// Without a specific function to address, no further Solidity code modifications can be provided under the constraints of the request.
