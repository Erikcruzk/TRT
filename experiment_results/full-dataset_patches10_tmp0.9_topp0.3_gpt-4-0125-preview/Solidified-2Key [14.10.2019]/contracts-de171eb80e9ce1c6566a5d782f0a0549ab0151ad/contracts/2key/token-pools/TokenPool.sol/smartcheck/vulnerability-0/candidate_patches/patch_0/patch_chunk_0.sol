// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(). Given the context and the concern about locked funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the request. Due to the absence of the mentioned function, it's not possible to provide a fix related to it.
// However, to address potential locked money issues, ensure mechanisms for fund withdrawal or upgrades are correctly implemented in contracts handling funds.
