// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(). 
// However, based on the details provided, there seems to be a general concern about funds being locked in the contract 
// without a way to withdraw or migrate them. Assuming the task is to ensure there's a mechanism for migrating resources 
// or funds safely, I'll add a hypothetical "beginMigration" function to the TokenPool contract that would 
// allow a migration of funds under certain conditions, ensuring it addresses the potential locked funds issue.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

// Add this function to the TokenPool contract
