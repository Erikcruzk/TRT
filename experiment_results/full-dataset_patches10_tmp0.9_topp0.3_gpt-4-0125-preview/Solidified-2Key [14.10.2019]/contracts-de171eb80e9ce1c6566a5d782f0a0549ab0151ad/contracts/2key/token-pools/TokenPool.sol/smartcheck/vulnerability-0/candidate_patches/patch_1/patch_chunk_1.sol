// This contract does not include a specific function named beginMigration(). However, based on the analysis and 
// the details provided, the vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) implies that funds might 
// get locked in the contract unintentionally. Since no specific function is related to this issue directly 
// in the provided code, and the task specifies to fix a vulnerability in beginMigration() which is not present, 
// it's not possible to provide a direct fix.

// If the intention was to ensure that the contract can handle funds correctly (e.g., allowing to withdraw or 
// migrate funds), a generic example solution could involve adding a withdraw function to safely extract funds. 
// However, since the "beginMigration" function isn't provided, here's a general-purpose withdrawal function 
// that could be added to address potential fund locking issues in a contract:

function withdraw(address _to, uint256 _amount) public onlyMaintainer {
    require(_to != address(0), "Invalid address");
    require(_amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient funds");
    _to.transfer(_amount);
}

// Note: The above code is meant as a generic example and might not directly apply to the provided context 
// since the specific beginMigration() function or its vulnerabilities are not detailed in the provided code snippets.
