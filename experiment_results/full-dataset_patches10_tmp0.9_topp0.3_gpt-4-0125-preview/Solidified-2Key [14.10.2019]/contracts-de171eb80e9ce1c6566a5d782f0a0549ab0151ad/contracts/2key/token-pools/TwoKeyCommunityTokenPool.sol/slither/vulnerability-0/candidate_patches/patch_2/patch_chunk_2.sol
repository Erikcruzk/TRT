// This contract does not contain a function explicitly named beginMigration().
// However, the vulnerability identified relates to the initialization of the state variable `registry`, which should be securely initialized in a function.
// Assuming the intent to fix this vulnerability, one would typically address it by securely initializing the `registry` in an appropriate initializer or constructor function.
// Below is an illustrative example of how one might modify an initialization function to securely set the `registry` variable upon contract creation or initialization.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Example constructor to securely initialize the `registry` state variable.
    // Note: Constructors were introduced in Solidity ^0.4.22, and this pattern is applicable here due to the pragma directive.
    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        require(address(_registry) != address(0), "Registry address cannot be zero.");
        registry = _registry;
