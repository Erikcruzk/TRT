// The provided code does not include a definition for beginMigration(), and the user's request seems to be based on a misunderstanding or typo.
// Based on the context and the reported vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY), no function named beginMigration() is found or described in the provided code snippet.
// To address the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability in the broader sense, it's important to ensure that contracts handling funds have mechanisms to transfer out those funds safely.
// Since there's no specific function to correct, below is a general example pattern to prevent locked funds in a contract, which might be what the user is looking for:

function withdraw() public {
    // Assuming there's an owner or similar role in your contract
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    require(balance > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
    (bool success, ) = owner.call.value(balance)("");
    require(success, "Failed to send Ether");
}
