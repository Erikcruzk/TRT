// This Solidity snippet does not directly correspond to a specific function named `beginMigration()`
// within the provided contract code. However, based on the vulnerability flagged by Slither regarding
// the uninitialized-state in `UpgradeabilityStorage` contract, I'll demonstrate how to initialize
// the `registry` in a secure manner within a hypothetical `beginMigration` function.
// Please note, this is an illustrative example as the provided code does not contain a `beginMigration` function.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    function beginMigration(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        // Example initialization function to securely set the registry. Adjust according to your specific requirements.
        // Ensure that only authorized accounts can perform migration.
        require(address(registry) == address(0), "Registry is already initialized");
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
