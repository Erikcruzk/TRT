// This is a placeholder function as the original prompt did not include a specific "beginMigration" function.
// Given the context and vulnerability mentioned, it's essential to ensure that any migration or upgrade mechanism does not lock in funds unintentionally.

// Assuming we need to add a safe migration initiation method to the Upgradable contract:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Existing code

    // Safe migration initiation method to prevent locked funds
    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Only the registry can initiate migration.");
        _implementation = newImplementation;
        // Additional safeguards and logic for migration can be implemented here
    }
}
