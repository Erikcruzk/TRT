// This Solidity code snippet does not contain a direct implementation of a `beginMigration()` function nor does it explicitly detail a vulnerability within an existing `beginMigration()` function.
// Given the context and the typical pattern of smart contract upgradeability, a safe implementation of a migration or upgrade initiation function should ensure:
// 1. Only authorized roles (e.g., admin or contract owner) can initiate the upgrade.
// 2. The contract has a mechanism to prevent loss of funds (e.g., by ensuring all funds are either withdrawn or transferred to the new contract version).
// 3. Adequate testing and validation are performed before switching to a new implementation to prevent locking funds in a faulty contract.

// Since no specific `beginMigration()` function is provided in the given contracts, below is a hypothetical implementation example that might be added to an upgradeable contract framework to address common concerns related to contract upgradability and fund safety.
