// There's no explicit function named beginMigration() in the provided contract code,
// and no direct vulnerability in the named functions. The reported issue might relate

// a function to begin migration (upgrade) could be something like the following,
// assuming the goal is to address potential fund locking by ensuring only authorized
// actions can initiate an upgrade.
