// There's no explicit function named beginMigration() in the provided contract code,

// However, based on the context and the typical structure of upgradeable contracts,
// a function to begin migration (upgrade) could be something like the following,
// assuming the goal is to address potential fund locking by ensuring only authorized
// actions can initiate an upgrade.
