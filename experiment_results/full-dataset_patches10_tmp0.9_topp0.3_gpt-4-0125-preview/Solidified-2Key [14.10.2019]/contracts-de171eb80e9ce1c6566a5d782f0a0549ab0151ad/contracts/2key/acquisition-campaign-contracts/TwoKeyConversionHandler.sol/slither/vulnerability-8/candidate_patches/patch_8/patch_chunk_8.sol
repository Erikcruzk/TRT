// This function is not present in the provided contract code.
// Since the task is to fix vulnerabilities in the beginMigration() function,
// and it is not included in the provided contract, a generic secure pattern for such a function is provided below.
// Note that without the specific context or requirements for beginMigration(), 
// the following is a conceptual implementation focusing on common Solidity best practices.

function beginMigration() external onlyOwner {
    // Assuming onlyOwner is a modifier ensuring that only the contract owner can trigger migration.

    // Ensure no reentrancy
    require(!migrationStarted, "Migration already started.");
    migrationStarted = true;

    // Further implementation would go here, for example:
    // - Changing contract state
    // - Transferring funds or assets
    // - Notifying another contract

    // Ensure to emit an event for the migration start
    emit MigrationStarted();

    // Reset the migration state if necessary at the end
    // migrationStarted = false; // Only if the migration process is meant to be repeatable
