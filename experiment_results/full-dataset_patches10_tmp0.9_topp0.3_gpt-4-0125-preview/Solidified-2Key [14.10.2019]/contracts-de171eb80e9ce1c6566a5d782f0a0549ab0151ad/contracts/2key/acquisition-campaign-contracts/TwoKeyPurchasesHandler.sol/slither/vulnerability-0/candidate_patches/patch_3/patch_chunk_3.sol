// This contract does not contain a specific beginMigration() function to be fixed.
// The reported issue is with an uninitialized state variable in UpgradeabilityCampaignStorage.
// Here's the initialization for _implementation which should be done in a constructor or an initializer function to avoid the reported vulnerability.

// Assuming the initialization should happen in a constructor or an initialization function for UpgradeabilityCampaignStorage:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityCampaignStorage {
    
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal twoKeyFactory;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Add a constructor or an initializer function to set _implementation
    constructor(address initialImplementation) public {
        _implementation = initialImplementation;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
