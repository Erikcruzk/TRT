// This function was not explicitly provided in the contract code above.
// However, based on the context and contract's structure, it seems you are looking for a function that could potentially start a migration process,
// which might involve transferring ownership or upgrading the contract in some form.
// Since no specific migration function exists in the provided contracts, below is an example of how a secure and a basic `beginMigration()` function might be implemented in a Solidity contract.
// This implementation assumes the goal is to prepare for contract upgrade or migration by an owner.

// Example `beginMigration()` function implementation in Solidity:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract MigrationControl is Ownable {
    address public newContractAddress;
    bool public migrationStarted;

    event MigrationStarted(address newAddress);

    constructor() public {
        migrationStarted = false;
    }

    function beginMigration(address _newAddress) public onlyOwner {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration has already begun.");
        require(_newAddress != address(0), "New address cannot be the zero address.");
        newContractAddress = _newAddress;
        migrationStarted = true;
        emit MigrationStarted(newContractAddress);
    }
}
