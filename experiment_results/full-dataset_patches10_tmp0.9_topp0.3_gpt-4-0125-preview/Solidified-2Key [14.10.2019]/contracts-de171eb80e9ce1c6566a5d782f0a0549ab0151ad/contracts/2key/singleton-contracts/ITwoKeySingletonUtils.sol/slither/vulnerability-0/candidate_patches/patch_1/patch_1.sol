// There is no specific function named beginMigration() or similar in the provided code snippet.
// Since the vulnerability mentioned is related to the uninitialized state variable 'TWO_KEY_SINGLETON_REGISTRY',
// There is no direct function to fix based on the given instructions. However, to initialize the variable,
// a constructor or an initializer function could be added. Here is an example on how to potentially fix it:

// Example constructor to set the TWO_KEY_SINGLETON_REGISTRY address upon deployment:
constructor(address _twoKeySingletonRegistry) {
    TWO_KEY_SINGLETON_REGISTRY = _twoKeySingletonRegistry;
}
