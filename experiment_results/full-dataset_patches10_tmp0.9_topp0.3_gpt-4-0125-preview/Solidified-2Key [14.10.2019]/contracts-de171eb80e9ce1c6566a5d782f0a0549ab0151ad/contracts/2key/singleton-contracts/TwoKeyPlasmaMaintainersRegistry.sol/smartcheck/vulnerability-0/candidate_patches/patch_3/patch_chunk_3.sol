// This contract does not contain a function specifically named beginMigration().
// However, based on the given context and vulnerability concern (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY), 
// there appears to be a misconception as the provided code does not directly involve or demonstrate
// a locked money issue in a specific function. The provided contracts focus on upgradeability and maintainers' management.
// If the concern is about ensuring that funds can be safely managed or withdrawn in the context of upgradeability or maintainers' management,
// a specific function addressing fund withdrawal or migration could be envisioned. However, such functionality is not directly outlined in the provided code.
// For addressing a general concern about locked funds in upgradeable contracts, one could consider adding a withdraw function to the Upgradeable or specific contract handling funds.

// Since no specific function `beginMigration()` is provided and based on the task description, here is a generic, secure template for a withdrawal function, 
// which could be part of addressing locked funds in a contract:

// Example withdraw function to prevent locked funds, which is not directly requested but relevant to the concern:
