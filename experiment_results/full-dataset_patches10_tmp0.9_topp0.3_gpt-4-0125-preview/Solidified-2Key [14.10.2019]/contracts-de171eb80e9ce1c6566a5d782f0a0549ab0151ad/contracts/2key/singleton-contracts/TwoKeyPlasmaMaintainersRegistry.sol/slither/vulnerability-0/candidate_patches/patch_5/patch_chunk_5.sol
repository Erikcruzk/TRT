// There is no explicit function named beginMigration in the provided contract code.
// Since the identified issue is with the uninitialized state variable 'registry' in the UpgradeabilityStorage contract,
// the fix should ensure 'registry' is properly initialized. However, without a specific context on how the registry is intended to be used or initialized,
// a generic approach would be to add a constructor or an initialization function to set the 'registry' value.

// Assuming the intention is to allow setting the 'registry' address upon deploying the UpgradeabilityStorage or its child contract,
// here's an example of how you might modify the UpgradeabilityStorage contract to include an initialization function for setting the registry.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    address internal _implementation;

    // Added initialization function to set the registry address
    function initializeRegistry(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) internal {
        require(address(registry) == address(0), "Registry already initialized.");
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}

// Note: This modification assumes that there's a specific moment/context (e.g., during deployment or a setup phase) where the registry can be securely set.
// The actual integration and use of 'initializeRegistry' would depend on the broader contract system and its initialization logic.
