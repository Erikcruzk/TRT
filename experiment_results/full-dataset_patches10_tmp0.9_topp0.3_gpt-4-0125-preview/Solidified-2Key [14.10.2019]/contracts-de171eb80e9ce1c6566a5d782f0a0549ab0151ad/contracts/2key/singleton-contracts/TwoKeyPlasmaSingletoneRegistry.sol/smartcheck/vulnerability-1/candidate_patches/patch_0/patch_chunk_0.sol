// This contract does not directly contain a beginMigration function or an explicit vulnerability associated

// for upgradeable contracts which could be considered if there was a beginMigration function.

// Assuming a function like beginMigration might be intended for upgrading the contract 
// while ensuring that funds are not locked in the contract unintentionally.
