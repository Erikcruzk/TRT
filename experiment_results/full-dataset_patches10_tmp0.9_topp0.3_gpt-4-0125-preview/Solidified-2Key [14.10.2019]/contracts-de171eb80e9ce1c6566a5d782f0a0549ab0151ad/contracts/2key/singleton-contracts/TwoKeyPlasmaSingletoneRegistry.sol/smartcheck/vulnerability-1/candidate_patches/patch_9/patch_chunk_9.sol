// This contract does not have a beginMigration function as per the provided code.
// However, to address the mentioned vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY) in the context of upgradability and migration,
// a hypothetical function to safely migrate funds from this contract to a new version could look like this:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    // Hypothetical function ensuring safe migration of funds
    function beginMigration(address newVersionAddress) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only authorized entities can initiate the migration
        uint balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance > 0); // Ensure there are funds to migrate
        require(newVersionAddress != address(0)); // Ensure the new version address is valid

        // Transfer the balance to the new contract version
        newVersionAddress.transfer(balance);
    }
