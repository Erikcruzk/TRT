// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any direct mention of funds management or transfer mechanisms that might directly relate to the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability as described. 
// The provided code does not include a function or specific mechanism where the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability can be directly addressed or corrected within a 'beginMigration()' function context.
// It's important to review the contract for any functions handling ether transfers, self-destruct patterns, or where ether might become locked unintentionally due to the contract's logic or absence of withdrawal mechanisms.
