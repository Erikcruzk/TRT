// This contract does not contain a definition for beginMigration(). Given the context, it appears there might be confusion or a request error. Below is a correction attempt by ensuring the registry variable is properly initialized in a function that might resemble what a beginMigration() could look like based on the context of upgradeability and initialization.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    function beginMigration(address newImplementation, address registryAddress) public {
        // Assume only authorized users can call this function
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized");
        require(registryAddress != address(0), "Registry address cannot be zero.");
        registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(registryAddress);
        _implementation = newImplementation;
        // Additional migration logic goes here
    }
}
