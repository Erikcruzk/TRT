// The provided code does not contain a `beginMigration()` function directly.
// However, to address the uninitialized state variable found by the Slither analysis,
// we can ensure proper initialization of the `registry` in the `UpgradeabilityStorage` contract.

// Assuming you need an example of how to initialize such a contract properly,
// here is a modification to the `UpgradeabilityStorage` contract including a constructor or an initializer for the `registry`:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

/* Other contract codes are omitted for brevity */

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Assuming you want to initialize the registry through a constructor or an initializer method
    function UpgradeabilityStorage(address _registryAddress) public {
        require(_registryAddress != address(0), "Registry address cannot be 0");
        registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(_registryAddress);
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}

// Note: Since `UpgradeabilityStorage` is used as a base contract, ensure that derived contracts
// properly pass the registry address to this constructor or handle the registry initialization
// logic in their context (for versions of Solidity that do not support constructors in derived contracts).
