// This is not a function but a constructor and it does not contain a reentrancy issue as flagged. The constructor is executed only once when the contract is deployed and cannot be re-entered.
// However, since you are looking for a solution related to the beginMigration() function which was not provided, I cannot supply a direct answer. Thus, I'll provide a generic safeguard against reentrancy for a hypothetical beginMigration() function.

// Hypothetical beginMigration() function with reentrancy protection
function beginMigration() public onlyTwoKeyAdmin {
    require(!migrationStarted, "Migration already started");
    migrationStarted = true;

    // Migration logic here

}
