// The provided Solidity code does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(). 
// There might be a misunderstanding or an incorrect request. 
// Given the instructions, here's a revised approach assuming the task was to adjust the shadowing issue:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract TwoKeyEconomy is StandardTokenModified {
    string public constant NAME = 'TwoKeyEconomy'; // changed to constant with uppercase
    string public constant SYMBOL = '2KEY'; // changed to constant with uppercase
    uint8 public constant DECIMALS = 18; // changed to constant with uppercase

    // The rest of your contract code here...

    function TwoKeyEconomy(
        address _twoKeyAdmin,
        address _twoKeySingletonRegistry
    )
    public
    {
        // Constructor logic here...
    }

    // Other functions here...
}
