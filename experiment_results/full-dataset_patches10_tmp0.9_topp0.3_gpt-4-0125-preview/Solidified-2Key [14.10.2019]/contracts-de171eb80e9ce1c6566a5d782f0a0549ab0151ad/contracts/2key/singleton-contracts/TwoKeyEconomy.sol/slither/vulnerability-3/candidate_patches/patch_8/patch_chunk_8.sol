// The provided code and the analysis do not indicate a specific function named beginMigration() or detail a reentrancy vulnerability within a clearly marked function. The analysis result mentions the vulnerability in the context of the constructor, which cannot be directly modified to address reentrancy concerns as constructors are not callable dynamically like functions. However, I'll provide a theoretical fix assuming there's a function meant to be addressed which isn't directly shown in the provided code. This theoretical fix is aimed at a function that could potentially be affected by reentrancy, given the context of the provided contract.

// Hypothetical beginMigration() function fix considering reentrancy protection
function beginMigration() external onlyTwoKeyAdmin {
    require(!migrationStarted, "Migration already started");
    migrationStarted = true;
    // Additional migration logic here
    // Ensure that any calls to external contracts or transfers of value are performed after all effects to the state.
