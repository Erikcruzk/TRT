// There's no explicit `beginMigration` function in the provided contract.
// Since the vulnerability mentioned is SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY in Upgradeable contract,
// but there's no direct evidence of locked money issue in the given code,
// adding a withdraw function could mitigate potential locked money issues in general.
// Assuming that adding such functionality could serve the purpose, here's an example:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {

    // Existing functions...

    // Function to withdraw Ether from the contract, mitigating locked funds issue.
    // Ensures only the owner or a specified admin can withdraw.
    function withdraw() public {
        // Placeholder for actual withdrawal logic, ensuring security and permissions
        // Typically, you'd check that `msg.sender` is the owner or an admin 
        // and then transfer Ether out of the contract.
    }
