// There was no specific function beginMigration() provided in the given contract code.
// However, to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned in the analysis results,
// ensure that all state variables are correctly initialized in the constructor or at the point of declaration.

// As an example to address similar vulnerabilities, you should initialize the ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry variable properly within a constructor or an initialization function if the contract is upgradeable.
// Since the provided code does not include a specific function or constructor for initialization, 
// I'll demonstrate how you might modify the UpgradeabilityStorage contract to include a constructor for initializing the registry:

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    constructor(ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry _registry) public {
        registry = _registry;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}

// Note: This code snippet is to demonstrate how to initialize the ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry variable to prevent the uninitialized-state vulnerability.
// You have to adapt this solution based on the actual requirements and structure of your contract, especially if it's designed to be upgradeable.
