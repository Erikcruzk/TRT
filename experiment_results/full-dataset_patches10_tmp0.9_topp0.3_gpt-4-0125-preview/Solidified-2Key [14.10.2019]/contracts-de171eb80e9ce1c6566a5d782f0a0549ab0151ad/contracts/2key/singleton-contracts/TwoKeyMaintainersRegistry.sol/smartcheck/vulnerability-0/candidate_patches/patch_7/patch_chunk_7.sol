// This code does not contain a specific function named beginMigration(), or any direct vulnerability named SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY within a function. 
// The provided code does not show a direct implementation related to money locking issues but points to an upgradeability pattern.
// If addressing general SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY concerns in upgradeable contracts, ensure safe migration paths and withdrawal functions are implemented.
// Since no specific function to fix was provided, and based on the given context, here's a general approach to add a safe withdrawal function to avoid locked funds:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Existing functions

    // Adding a withdrawal function to avoid locked funds, ensuring only authorized addresses can trigger it
    function withdraw() public {
        // Implementation specifics would depend on the contract's design,
        // typically involving a check for permissions and then transferring funds.
        // Example:
        require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only an authorized address can withdraw
        address(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance); // Transfer all Ether to the caller
    }
}
