// This code snippet is not vulnerable as it does not contain the beginMigration function or any direct vulnerability.
// Since there is no specific vulnerable function named beginMigration provided in the given code,
// and the provided code does not directly show or indicate a vulnerability related to locked money (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// it's not possible to fix a vulnerability that hasn't been explicitly identified in a specific function.
