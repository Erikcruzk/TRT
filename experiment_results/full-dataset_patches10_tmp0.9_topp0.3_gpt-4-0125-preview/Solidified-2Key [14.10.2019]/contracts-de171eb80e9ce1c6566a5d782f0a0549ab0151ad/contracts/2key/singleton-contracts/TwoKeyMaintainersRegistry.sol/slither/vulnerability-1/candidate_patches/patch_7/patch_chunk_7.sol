// No specific function `beginMigration()` found in the provided contract code.
// However, to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned for the `_implementation` variable in `UpgradeabilityStorage` contract,
// here's a modification to safely initialize `_implementation` with a setter function. This ensures that `_implementation` is not left uninitialized.

        // Only allow the registry or a specific admin role to update the implementation to follow best practices
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized");
        require(newImplementation != address(0), "Invalid address");
