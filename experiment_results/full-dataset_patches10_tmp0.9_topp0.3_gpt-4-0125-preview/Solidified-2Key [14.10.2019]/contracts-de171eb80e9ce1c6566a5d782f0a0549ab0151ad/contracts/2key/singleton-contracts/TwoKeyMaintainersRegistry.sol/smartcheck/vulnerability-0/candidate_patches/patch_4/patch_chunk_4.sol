// There's no beginMigration() function in the provided code.
// However, based on the description of the vulnerability, 
// it looks like the issue might be related to a pattern or an expected function 
// that should manage or prevent locking of funds unintentionally in the contract.
// Since the specific function to address the issue isn't provided in your code,
// here's a general safeguard pattern that you might include:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    address private owner;

    function beginMigration() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can begin migration");
        // Additional migration logic here
    }

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Ensure this contract can receive funds
    function() external payable {}

    // Withdraw function to prevent locking of funds
    function withdraw() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
