// This specific request does not directly relate to a function named beginMigration().
// However, based on the given context and the issue highlighted by the analysis tool,
// the uninitialized-state vulnerability concerns the `registry` in the `UpgradeabilityStorage` contract.
// To address the issue, here's how you might initialize the `registry` properly in a function or constructor.
// Since the exact initialization context is not provided, this is a generic example.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    // Example function to initialize the registry
    function initializeRegistry(address _registryAddress) public {
        require(address(registry) == address(0), "Registry already initialized.");
        registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(_registryAddress);
    }
}

// Note: The actual solution may vary based on how and where you need to initialize the `registry`.
// This example assumes you have a function to safely initialize it post-deployment.
