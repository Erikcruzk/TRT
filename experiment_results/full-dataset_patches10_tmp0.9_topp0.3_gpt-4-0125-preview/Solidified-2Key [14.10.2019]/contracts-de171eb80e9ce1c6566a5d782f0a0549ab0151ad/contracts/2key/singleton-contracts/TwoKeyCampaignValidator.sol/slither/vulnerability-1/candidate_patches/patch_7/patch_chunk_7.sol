// There is no specific beginMigration() function in the provided contracts.
// However, the reported vulnerability relates to the uninitialized state variable _implementation in the UpgradeabilityStorage contract.
// To address this, a possible solution is to ensure _implementation is initialized properly. 
// Since there's no direct function provided for this task, an exemplary solution on how to initialize it could be through a constructor or an initializer function in the UpgradeabilityStorage contract or its inheritor. 

// Assuming the intention was to add a function to initialize or update _implementation securely, here's an illustrative example:
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only the registry can initiate the migration.
        _implementation = newImplementation;
    }
}
