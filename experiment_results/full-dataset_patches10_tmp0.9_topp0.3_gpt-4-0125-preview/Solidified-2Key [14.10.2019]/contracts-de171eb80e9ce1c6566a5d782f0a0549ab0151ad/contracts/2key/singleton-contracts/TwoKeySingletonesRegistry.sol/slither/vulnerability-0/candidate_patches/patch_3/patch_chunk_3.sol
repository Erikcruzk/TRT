// The provided code does not contain a `beginMigration()` function or any direct mention of 
// functionality related to migration within the given contracts. 
// Therefore, it's not possible to provide a fixed version of a `beginMigration()` function 
// without further context or understanding of what the intended functionality is. 

// Since the user's request cannot be addressed as there's no `beginMigration()` function to fix, 
// no Solidity code pertaining specifically to fixing vulnerabilities in such a function can be provided.
