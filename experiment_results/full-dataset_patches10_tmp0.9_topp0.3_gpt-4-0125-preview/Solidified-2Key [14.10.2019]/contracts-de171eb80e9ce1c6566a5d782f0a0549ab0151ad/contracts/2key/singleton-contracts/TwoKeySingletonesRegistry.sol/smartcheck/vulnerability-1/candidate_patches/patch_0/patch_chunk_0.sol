// This function is part of a contract that is not explicitly shown in the given code. 
// However, based on the context and the described problem, 
// a likely function that could start a migration process and potentially deal with the issue mentioned would look like this:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract SomeContract {
    bool private migrationStarted;
    address private owner;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        migrationStarted = false;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    function beginMigration() public onlyOwner {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration has already been started.");
        migrationStarted = true;

        // Add migration logic here
    }

    // Additional functions to complete migration...
}
