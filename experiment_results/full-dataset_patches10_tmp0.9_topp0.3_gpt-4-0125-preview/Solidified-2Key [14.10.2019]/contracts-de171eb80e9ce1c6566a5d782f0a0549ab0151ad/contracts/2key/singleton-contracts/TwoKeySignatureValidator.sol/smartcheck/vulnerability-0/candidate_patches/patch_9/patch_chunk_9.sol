// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration().
// However, the request mentions fixing a vulnerability related to locked funds within contracts.
// The provided code does not demonstrate a direct issue with locked funds, but generally,
// to address concerns around locked funds in upgradeable contracts, ensure there is a mechanism to withdraw funds or migrate them to a new contract.

// An example mechanism to allow contract funds withdrawal or migration could look like this:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {

    // Example function to allow fund migration to a new contract
    // Note: Ensure proper access control is implemented for security
    function beginMigration(address newContractAddress) public {
        // Example of an access control mechanism, replace with actual implementation
        require(msg.sender == address(registry)); // Ensure only authorized entities can perform migration

        uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
        require(contractBalance > 0, "No funds to migrate");
        
        // Logic to transfer funds to the new contract
        newContractAddress.transfer(contractBalance);
    }
}
