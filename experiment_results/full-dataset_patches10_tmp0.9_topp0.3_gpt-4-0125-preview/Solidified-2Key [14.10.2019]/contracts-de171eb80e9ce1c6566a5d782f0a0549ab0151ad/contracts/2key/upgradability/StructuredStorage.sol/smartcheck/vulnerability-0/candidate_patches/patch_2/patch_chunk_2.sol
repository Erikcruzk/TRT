// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerabilities related to locking funds (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY).
// However, given the context and typical issues related to upgradeability and funds, it's important to ensure that funds can be migrated or withdrawn.
// Since no specific function is provided, below is an illustrative example of how one might implement a safe migration pattern in such upgradeable contracts.

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Example of a safe migration function pattern
    bool private _migrationStarted;
    address private _newVersionAddress;

    function beginMigration(address newVersion) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Only registry can start migration");

        _newVersionAddress = newVersion;
        _migrationStarted = true;
    }

    // Additional functions to handle the migration could be implemented here
    // For instance, transferring any balance this contract holds to the new version
    // Or allowing users to migrate their own data if necessary
