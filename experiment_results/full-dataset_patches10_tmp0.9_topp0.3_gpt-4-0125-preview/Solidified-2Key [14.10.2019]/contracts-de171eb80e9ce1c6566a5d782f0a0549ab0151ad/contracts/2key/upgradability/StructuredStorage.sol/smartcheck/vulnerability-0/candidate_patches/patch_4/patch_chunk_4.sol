// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function as described.
// However, the potential issue of locked funds pointed out refers to the absence of a method
// to withdraw or manage funds that may be sent to this contract either by mistake or design.
// Since there was no specific beginMigration() function provided in the given code,
// and considering the feedback regarding locked funds, a generic solution is to add
// a withdraw function to allow the contract owner or specific role to withdraw funds.

// Below is an example function that could be added to the Upgradeable contract to mitigate
// the mentioned concern. This example assumes the addition of an owner mechanism for simplicity.
