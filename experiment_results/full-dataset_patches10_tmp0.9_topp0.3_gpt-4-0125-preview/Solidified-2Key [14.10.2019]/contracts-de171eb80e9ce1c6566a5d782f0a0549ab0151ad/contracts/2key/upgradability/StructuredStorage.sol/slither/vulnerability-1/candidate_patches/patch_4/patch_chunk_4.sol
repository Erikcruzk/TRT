// This code block does not directly contain a vulnerable function related to the uninitialized-state vulnerability.
// The issue is with the uninitialized state variable `_implementation` in the `UpgradeabilityStorage` contract.
// However, ensuring proper initialization of `_implementation` can mitigate this. Here is a hypothetical function `beginMigration`
// to properly initialize `_implementation` within the context of the provided contracts.
