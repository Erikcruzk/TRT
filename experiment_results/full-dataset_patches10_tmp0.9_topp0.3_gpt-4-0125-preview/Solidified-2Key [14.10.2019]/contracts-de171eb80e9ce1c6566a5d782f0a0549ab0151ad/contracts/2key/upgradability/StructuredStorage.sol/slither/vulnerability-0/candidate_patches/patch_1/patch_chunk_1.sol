// This code snippet is provided as is, without a specific vulnerable function named `beginMigration`.
// Since no function `beginMigration` is provided in the given code and the user requested fixes for it,
// a plausible action considering the context is to initialize the `registry` in the `UpgradeabilityStorage` to address the reported vulnerability.
// However, without a direct request or specifics on how `beginMigration` should function within the given codebase, providing a fix for an uninitialized state vulnerability in a non-existent function is not feasible.
// Therefore, the best approach is to show a generic way to initialize a state variable within a constructor or an initializer method, which could be applied generally in Solidity:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    function UpgradeabilityStorage(address _registryAddress) public {
        registry = ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry(_registryAddress);
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
