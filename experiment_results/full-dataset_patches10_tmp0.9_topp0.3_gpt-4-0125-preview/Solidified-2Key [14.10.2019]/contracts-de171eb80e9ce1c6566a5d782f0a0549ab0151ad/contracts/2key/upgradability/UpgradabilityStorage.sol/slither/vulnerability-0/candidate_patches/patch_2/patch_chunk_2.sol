// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration()
// and the provided code snippet does not exhibit a direct vulnerability in a function.
// The uninitialized-state vulnerability refers to the `_implementation` state variable.
// To address the general concern, ensure proper initialization of `_implementation` in a constructor or a specific function as per your contract design.

// Since the specific function to fix was requested but not found, here's an illustrative approach to initialize the `_implementation` safely in a constructor or function.

    // ensure proper access control is in place to prevent unauthorized updates.
