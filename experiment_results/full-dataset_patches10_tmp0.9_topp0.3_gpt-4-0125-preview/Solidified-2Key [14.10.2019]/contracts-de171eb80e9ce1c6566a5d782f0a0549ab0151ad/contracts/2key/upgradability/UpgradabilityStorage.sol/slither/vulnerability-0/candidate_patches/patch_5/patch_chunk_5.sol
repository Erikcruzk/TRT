// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerability fixing task.
// Given the uninitialized-state vulnerability, ensure to properly initialize all state variables in your contract's constructor or relevant functions.
// However, as per the instructions, here's an approach to initialize _implementation safely in a hypothetical scenario:

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;
    address internal _implementation;

    function UpgradeabilityStorage(address initialImplementation) public {
        _implementation = initialImplementation;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
