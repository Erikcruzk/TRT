// This contract does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit function that directly indicates a vulnerability related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY. 
// However, addressing the general concern of funds potentially being locked in the contract, 
// it's important to ensure that there's a way to recover funds or upgrade the contract properly.
// Below is an implementation of a hypothetical beginMigration() function that might be added to safely transfer funds to a new contract version, assuming this is the intended fix.

// Note: This code is hypothetical and should be adapted according to the specific requirements and structure of the original contract.
