This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

slither Analysis Results
Vulnerability: locked-ether found in the following piece of code:

    function initialize(address sender) public payable {

        require(msg.sender == address(registry));


The contract is among the source code below:



pragma solidity ^0.4.24;





interface ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry {

    



    event ProxyCreated(address proxy);


    




    event VersionAdded(string version, address implementation);

    




    function addVersion(string _contractName, string version, address implementation) public;

    





    function getVersion(string _contractName, string version) public view returns (address);
}



pragma solidity ^0.4.24;





contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    ITwoKeySingletonesRegistry internal registry;

    
    address internal _implementation;

    



    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}



pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    



    function initialize(address sender) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry));
    }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
