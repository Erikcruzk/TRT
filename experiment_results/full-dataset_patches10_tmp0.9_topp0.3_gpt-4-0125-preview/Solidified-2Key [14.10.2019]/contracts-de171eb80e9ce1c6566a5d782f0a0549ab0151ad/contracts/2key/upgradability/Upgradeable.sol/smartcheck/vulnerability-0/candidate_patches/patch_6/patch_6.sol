// There wasn't a specific `beginMigration()` function in the provided code. However, to address
// potential locked money issues in contracts, a safe withdrawal pattern could be incorporated.
// Below is an illustrative example of how one might implement such a function in a contract
// that could be considered part of an upgrade or migration strategy:
