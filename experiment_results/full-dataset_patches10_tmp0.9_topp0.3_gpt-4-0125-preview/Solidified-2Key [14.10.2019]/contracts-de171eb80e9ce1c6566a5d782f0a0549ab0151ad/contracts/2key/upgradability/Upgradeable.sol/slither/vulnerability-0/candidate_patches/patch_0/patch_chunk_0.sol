// This function is not directly present in the provided contract code. However, based on the context and common practices in upgradeable contracts, 
// a hypothetical `beginMigration` function might look like this after being fixed for potential vulnerabilities:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    function beginMigration(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Unauthorized sender"); // Ensuring only the registry can initiate the migration
        _implementation = newImplementation;
    }
}
