// There's no direct vulnerability inside a function called `beginMigration` provided in the given code.

// it's crucial to ensure proper initialization. Since the provided code does not include a `beginMigration` function
// or a direct way to initialize the `registry` variable within the given context, a generic approach to
// safely initialize the `registry` within a contract setup could look like this:

contract UpgradeabilityStorageWithInit is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Function to safely initialize the registry state variable
