// This function is not directly related to the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability as described.
// However, ensuring the contract can properly manage or forward its balance might mitigate concerns related to locked funds.
// The provided contract code does not include a specific function named 'beginMigration()', nor does it detail mechanisms for handling or forwarding its Ether balance.
// Below is a hypothetical implementation to safely withdraw funds to a designated owner or updater, assuming this might be the intended fix for a locked money scenario in an upgradeable contract context.
