// This function is not directly related to the reported vulnerability (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// but as requested, providing the code related to potential start of a migration process:
// There wasn't a specific `beginMigration()` function in the provided code. However, to address
// potential locked money issues in contracts, a safe withdrawal pattern could be incorporated.
// Below is an illustrative example of how one might implement such a function in a contract
// that could be considered part of an upgrade or migration strategy:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Upgradeable is UpgradeabilityStorage {
    // Adding an event for logging migration starts
    event MigrationStarted(address initiator);

    // Example function to begin a migration process
    function beginMigration() public {
        require(msg.sender == address(registry), "Only the registry can begin migration");
        emit MigrationStarted(msg.sender);
        // Additional migration logic here
    }
}
