// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any explicit vulnerability related to locked funds as described.
// However, to address the potential concern of locked funds in a general context of upgradeable contracts, 
// ensuring there's a way to migrate or manage funds is crucial. Since the provided code does not include a specific 
// function named beginMigration, here's an illustrative addition that could help mitigate such concerns by allowing 
// an upgrade to a new contract which can manage the funds:
