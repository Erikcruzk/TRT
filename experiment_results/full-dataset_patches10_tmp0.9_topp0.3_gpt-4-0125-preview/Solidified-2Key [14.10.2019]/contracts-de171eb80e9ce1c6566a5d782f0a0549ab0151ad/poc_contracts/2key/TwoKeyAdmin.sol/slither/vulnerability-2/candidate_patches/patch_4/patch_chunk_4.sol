// This Solidity code snippet does not directly correspond to the specific request for a `beginMigration` function or any direct vulnerability fix,
// as the provided code does not include a function with that name or context. However, based on the information provided and the structure of the contracts,
// a potential vulnerability fix in a hypothetical `beginMigration` function (focused on an administrative task like migrating to a new contract) is outlined below.
// Note: Implement this considering the context and the actual contract's requirements.
