// This contract does not contain a function named "beginMigration()", and the provided vulnerability is related to state variable shadowing, which does not pertain to a specific function. If you meant fixing the shadowing issue, here's a suggested fix for the contract `StandardToken`:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract StandardToken is ERC20Basic {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    uint256 internal totalSupply_;
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint8 public decimals; // This is the shadowed state variable

    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) internal allowed;
    mapping(address => uint256) internal balances;

    // Rest of the contract code...
}
