// The provided code does not contain a beginMigration() function or any explicit vulnerability associated with a function of that name.
// Therefore, I cannot provide a corrected version of beginMigration() as it does not exist in the provided code.
// For the identified vulnerability of shadowing-state, the issue is with the state variable 'symbol' being declared in both the parent contract (StandardToken) and the child contract (TwoKeyEconomy).
// However, you requested only the code for beginMigration(), which isn't present in the provided details.
