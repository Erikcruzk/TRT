// The vulnerability mentioned does not pertain to a specific function but to a state variable shadowing issue.
// Since there is no actual `beginMigration()` function in the provided code, and the request was for its fixed code,
// there seems to be a misunderstanding. However, the shadowing issue can be addressed by removing the shadowed declaration
// in the derived contract. Here's the adjusted relevant part of the EnigmaToken contract without the unnecessary shadowing:

contract EnigmaToken is StandardToken {
    // Removed the shadowed declarations of `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` as they are already defined in `StandardToken`
    uint256 public constant INITIAL_SUPPLY = 150000000 * 10**8;  
    uint256 public totalSupply;

    constructor() public {
        totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY;                               
        balances[msg.sender] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;                      
        emit Transfer(0x0, msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
    }

    // Other functions remain unchanged
}
