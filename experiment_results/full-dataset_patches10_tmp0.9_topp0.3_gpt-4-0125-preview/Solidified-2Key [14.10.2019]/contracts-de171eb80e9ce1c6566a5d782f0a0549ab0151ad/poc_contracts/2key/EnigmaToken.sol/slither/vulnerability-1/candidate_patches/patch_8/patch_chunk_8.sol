// The provided code does not contain a function or details directly named `beginMigration()`. The vulnerability mentioned is related to variable shadowing in Solidity, particularly with the `symbol` state variable in the contract. Given that no specific function `beginMigration()` exists in the provided code to fix, and addressing the identified issue isn't directly related to a single function but rather to the declaration of the `symbol` state variable, below is a revised approach to declare `symbol` without shadowing for clarity:

// Fixing the vulnerability by removing the shadowed declaration in the EnigmaToken contract
contract EnigmaToken is StandardToken {
    string public constant name = "Enigma";                                      
    // Removed the shadowed declaration of `symbol` here since it is already declared in `StandardToken` contract
    uint8 public constant decimals = 8;                                          
    uint256 public constant INITIAL_SUPPLY = 150000000 * 10**8;  
    uint256 public totalSupply;

    constructor() public {
        totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY;                               
        balances[msg.sender] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;                      
        emit Transfer(0x0, msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
    }
// Other functions remain unchanged
}
