// The provided code does not contain a function named beginMigration(). The vulnerability mentioned is about state variable shadowing.
// Since there is no specific function to correct based on the user's request, here is the fixed declaration for the shadowed state variable in the EnigmaToken contract.

// Fixed version:

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract EnigmaToken is StandardToken {
    // Removed the shadowing declarations to use the inherited ones
    uint256 public constant INITIAL_SUPPLY = 150000000 * 10**uint256(decimals);  
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    
    constructor() public {
        name = "Enigma"; // This line alters the inherited state variable instead of declaring a new one
        symbol = "ENG"; // This line alters the inherited state variable instead of declaring a new one
        decimals = 8; // This line alters the inherited state variable instead of declaring a new one
        totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY;                               
        balances[msg.sender] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;                      
        emit Transfer(0x0, msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
    }

    // The rest of the contract code remains unchanged.
