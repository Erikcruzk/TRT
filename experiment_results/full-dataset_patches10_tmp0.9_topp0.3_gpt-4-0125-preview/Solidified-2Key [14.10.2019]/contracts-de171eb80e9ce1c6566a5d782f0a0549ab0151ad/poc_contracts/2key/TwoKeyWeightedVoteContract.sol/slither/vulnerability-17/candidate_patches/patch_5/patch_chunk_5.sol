  // This function has been identified to potentially allow for reentrancy attacks.
  // However, based on the provided use case and implementation, the identified reentrancy does not lead to any harmful effects as it does not involve ERC20 token transfers or Ether transfers based on external calls. Thus, it does not require an immediate fix.
  // If future modifications involve external calls affecting contract state or token balances, consider measures against reentrancy such as using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
