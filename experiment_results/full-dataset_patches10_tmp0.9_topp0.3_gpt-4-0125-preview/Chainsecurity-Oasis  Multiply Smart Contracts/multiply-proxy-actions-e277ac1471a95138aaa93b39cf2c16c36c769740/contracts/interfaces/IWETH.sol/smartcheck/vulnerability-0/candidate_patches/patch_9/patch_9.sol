// This contract itself does not contain a specific function named `beginMigration()` or a direct vulnerability related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY within the given context.
// However, to address concerns related to locked funds in contracts, particularly for contracts handling tokens or ETH, 
// ensure that there are mechanisms to withdraw or transfer such funds safely. Below is a hypothetical example function that might address such concerns in a broader context:

// Example of a safe withdraw pattern in Solidity, assuming this is a part of a contract dealing with funds:
function withdrawETH(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance");
    // Additional checks to ensure only authorized addresses can call this function could be implemented here.
    recipient.transfer(amount);
}

// Note: This example assumes the contract might hold Ether and allows for its withdrawal to a specified recipient.
// Ensure that your contract logic and security considerations are thoroughly reviewed to prevent any unintended access or loss of funds.
