// There's no specific function given directly in the provided context that shows the vulnerability.
// However, based on the indication of SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY in the abstract contract IWETH,
// we can infer that the issue might relate to how funds are handled.
// Given that, we can't modify an abstract contract directly to show a fixed example,
// as abstract contracts are meant to be implemented by other contracts.
// It would be more appropriate to show how a contract implementing IWETH might prevent locked funds.

// Hypothetical implementation example avoiding the locked money issue:

contract WETH is IWETH {
    mapping(address => uint256) public override balanceOf;

// could potentially lock funds if not properly implemented.
