// There's no specific function given directly in the provided context that shows the vulnerability.
// However, based on the indication of SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY in the abstract contract IWETH,
// we can infer that the issue might relate to how funds are handled.
// Given that, we can't modify an abstract contract directly to show a fixed example,
// as abstract contracts are meant to be implemented by other contracts.
// It would be more appropriate to show how a contract implementing IWETH might prevent locked funds.

// Hypothetical implementation example avoiding the locked money issue:

pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract WETH is IWETH {
    mapping(address => uint256) public override balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public override allowance;

    // Other necessary implementations ...

    function deposit() public payable override {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit value must be greater than 0");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        // Emit an event here if necessary
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public override {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance to withdraw");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        // Emit an event here if necessary
    }

    // Other necessary implementations ...
}
// Note: Without specifying a vulnerable function or a more specific scenario,
// the fix mainly addresses a common issue where functions like deposit or withdraw
// could potentially lock funds if not properly implemented.
