// Since no specific function was provided with a vulnerability related to SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY,
// and the given code does not directly show misuse of funds or locking of money in an obvious manner,
// it's not possible to correct a specific function for that issue without more context.
// Therefore, an assumption will be made that you're asking for a generic fix that often relates to
// vulnerabilities concerning locking funds in a contract unnecessarily or without a way to retrieve them.

// Assuming the issue might be related to not being able to withdraw funds or similar, 
// typically, a safe withdraw function is implemented to address funds potentially getting locked. 
// Here is an example of how you might implement a secure withdrawal pattern in a contract, 
// although this exact method might not directly apply to the abstract contract provided:

pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

// Example contract implementing a safe withdraw function
contract SafeWithdraw {
    address private owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Modifier to restrict function execution to the owner
    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }

    // Function to safely withdraw funds to the owner's address
    function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
        (bool sent, ) = owner.call{value: balance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

    // Fallback function to accept deposits
    receive() external payable {}
