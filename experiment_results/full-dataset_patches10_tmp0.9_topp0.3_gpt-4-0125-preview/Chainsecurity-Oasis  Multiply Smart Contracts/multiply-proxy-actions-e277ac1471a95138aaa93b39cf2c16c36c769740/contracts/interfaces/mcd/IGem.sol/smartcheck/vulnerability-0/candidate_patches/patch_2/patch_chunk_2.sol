// This contract does not contain any functions explicitly related to the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability as described. 
// The provided contract is an abstract contract defining an interface without any implementations that could directly lock funds.
// If fixing a hypothetical or indirect vulnerability, consider reviewing any implementation of this interface 
// to ensure that there are proper mechanisms to withdraw or move any funds stored in contracts inheriting from IGem.
