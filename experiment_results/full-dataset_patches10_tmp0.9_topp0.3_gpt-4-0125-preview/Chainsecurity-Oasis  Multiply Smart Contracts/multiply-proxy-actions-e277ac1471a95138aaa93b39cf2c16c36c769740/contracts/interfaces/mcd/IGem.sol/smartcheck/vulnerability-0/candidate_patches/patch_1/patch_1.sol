// This contract does not contain a specific function that holds the vulnerability directly.
// The alert might be due to the nature of the functions within the contract being abstract and their implementations,
// or due to the overall structure that could potentially lock funds without a clear way to retrieve them,
// but without the implementation of these functions, it's not possible to provide a direct fix.
// Ensure the implementing contract has safe mechanisms for fund withdrawal and proper access controls.
