// This contract does not contain a beginMigration function or any other function directly handling funds or locking mechanisms as described in the provided analysis result. The contracts provided define interfaces and abstract contracts without implementation details that would directly lead to a SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue. Therefore, there's no specific function to fix based on the provided context and details. For addressing the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability, one would typically ensure that functions that handle funds have proper access controls, checks, and mechanisms to prevent locking of funds unintentionally, but this cannot be applied without concrete function implementations.
