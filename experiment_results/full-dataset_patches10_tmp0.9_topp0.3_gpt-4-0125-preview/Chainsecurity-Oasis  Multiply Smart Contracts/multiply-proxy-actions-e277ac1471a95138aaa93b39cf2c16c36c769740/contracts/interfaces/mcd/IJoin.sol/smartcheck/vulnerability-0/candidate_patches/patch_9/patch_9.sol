// This contract does not contain a function called beginMigration(), and the reported vulnerability does not directly pertain to a specific function that can be fixed with a code snippet. The provided contracts are interfaces without implementation details where funds could be locked unintentionally. Implementations of these methods in actual contracts should ensure proper handling of funds to avoid the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue. Since no specific function like beginMigration() is provided or detailed, fixing a vulnerability cannot be directly addressed without more context on how these interfaces are implemented in a concrete contract.
