// Since there's no specific function identified as vulnerable directly from the given details,
// and considering the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY finding is usually about Ether getting locked without a way to withdraw,
// there seems to be a misunderstanding as the provided contracts are interfaces without implementation details.
// A hypothetical fix could involve ensuring implemented contracts have mechanisms to transfer Ether or tokens appropriately.
// However, without a specific implementation to address, here's a generic fix approach in an actual function context:

// Hypothetical beginMigration function in an implementing contract that could address the concern:

pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract ExampleContract {
    address public admin;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    // Example function ensuring only the admin can call it and no Ether is locked unintentionally
    function beginMigration() external payable {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can migrate");
        // Ensure all conditions for migration are met, then perform actions
        // If any ether is sent with this transaction, refund it back to the sender
        msg.sender.transfer(msg.value);
    }
