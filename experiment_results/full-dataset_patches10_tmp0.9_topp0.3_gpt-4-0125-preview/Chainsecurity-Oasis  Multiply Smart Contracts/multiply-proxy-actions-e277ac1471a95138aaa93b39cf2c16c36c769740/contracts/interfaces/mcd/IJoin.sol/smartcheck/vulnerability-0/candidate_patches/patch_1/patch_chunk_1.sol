// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), nor does it display an explicit vulnerability related to locking funds in its provided functions. The provided code does not include a specific implementation that would directly relate to the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY issue, as this issue typically involves contracts that unintentionally hold funds without a way to retrieve them. The contracts IGem and IJoin are interfaces for token interactions and do not inherently lock funds without the context of their implementation in a full contract that would utilize these interfaces.

// There is no specific function to fix based on the given task description and the provided code. The user may need to check the implementation contracts that use these interfaces to identify and correct any issues related to locked funds.
