// There is no specific function named `beginMigration` in the provided code.
// However, based on the feedback and vulnerability mentioned (SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY),
// it appears the vulnerability notice is likely due to misunderstanding or a mistake,
// as the described contracts are interfaces/abstract contracts without implementation that could lock funds.
// Thus, no specific vulnerability-fixing code change can be applied without additional context or implementation details.
