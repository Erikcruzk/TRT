// The provided code does not contain a specific implementation of beginMigration() function
// or any indication of where or how funds might be locked unintentionally. 
// Therefore, a generic example that could address typical issues related to locked funds 
// in a migration function in Solidity is given below:

function beginMigration(address newContractAddress) external onlyOwner {
    require(newContractAddress != address(0), "New contract address cannot be 0x0");
    // Assuming there's a balance or asset to migrate to the new contract, 
    // and there's a function in the new contract designed to accept this migration process.
    uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
    
    // Ensure that the contract has a non-zero balance to migrate
    if (contractBalance > 0) {
        // Recommended: Ensure the new contract has a function to receive ETH and handle it properly.
        // It's crucial to have a safe mechanism on the newContract to handle incoming ETH or tokens.
        (bool sent, ) = newContractAddress.call{value: contractBalance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
    
    // Add here any additional logic needed for migration, such as token transfer, state copying, etc.
    // Emit an event or take necessary actions to finalize the migration.
}

// Note: This is a template and should be adjusted to fit the specifics of the actual contract logic and requirements.
// It's critical to ensure all conditions under which funds could become locked are addressed.
// Always test thoroughly in a test environment before deploying.
