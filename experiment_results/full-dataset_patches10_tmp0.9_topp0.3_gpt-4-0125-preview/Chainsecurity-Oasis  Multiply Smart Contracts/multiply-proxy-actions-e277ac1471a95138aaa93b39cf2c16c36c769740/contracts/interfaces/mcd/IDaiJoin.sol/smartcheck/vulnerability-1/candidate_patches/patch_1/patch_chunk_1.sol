// As there is no direct information about the function `beginMigration`, and based on the provided details,
// it's not possible to correct a specific vulnerability without seeing the actual code that is vulnerable.
// Typically, a `locked money` issue could arise from functions that handle ether transfers or contract interactions
// where ether can become trapped. As there was no function provided directly within your query, I'll demonstrate
// a general safer pattern for a placeholder `beginMigration` function that involves transferring ether in Solidity,
// assuming it might be related to your concern. This should not be considered a direct fix but rather an illustrative example.

// Assuming `beginMigration` might involve transferring ether or handling balances, here is a safer template:

pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract MigrationContract {
    address public owner;
    bool public migrationStarted;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    // Placeholder example function to demonstrate handling ether safely.
    function beginMigration() external onlyOwner {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration already started.");
        migrationStarted = true;

        // Example of safely interacting with another contract (e.g., for withdrawing or transferring ether)
        // It is critical to ensure that the calling contract can handle re-entrancy attacks or similar vulnerabilities.

        // Logic to transfer ether or interact with other contracts safely here

        // Emit an event or include additional logic as needed
    }
