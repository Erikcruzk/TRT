// As the provided code does not include a specific function called beginMigration(), 
// and based on the information given, there's no direct vulnerability in the form of a function to fix.
// The concern raised is related to a potential "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" issue, 
// which typically involves functions that handle ether transfers or similar operations improperly, 
// but without a specific function or context, providing a fix is not directly applicable.

// For educational purposes, if a function like beginMigration() was supposed to transfer funds or had operations 
// that could lead into locking funds unintentionally, a generalized secure pattern might look like this:

// Example of a safe function structure to avoid locking funds without context to specific vulnerability:
function beginMigration() public {
    // Implement the logic intended for migration, ensuring that any transfer of funds
    // is performed securely and does not result in locked funds.
    // This could involve checks on contract balances, user permissions, and using secure transfer methods.
