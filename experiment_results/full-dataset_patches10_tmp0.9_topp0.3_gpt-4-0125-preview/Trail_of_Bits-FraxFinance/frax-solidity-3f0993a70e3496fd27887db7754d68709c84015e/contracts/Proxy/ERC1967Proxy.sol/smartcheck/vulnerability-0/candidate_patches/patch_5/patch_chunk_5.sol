// There is no specific function named beginMigration() provided in the given contract code.
// If the task is to address the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability mentioned, there is no direct function or pattern in the given code that locks funds in a manner typically associated with this vulnerability label (e.g., lacking a way to withdraw or transfer Ether stored in the contract). The contracts provided are primarily focused on proxy functionality and the management of implementation addresses for upgradeable contracts.

// However, to ensure the contracts can manage Ether securely and avoid potential locked funds, consider reviewing and including withdrawal patterns or functions in your main or proxy contracts, which this code does not directly alter or provide.
