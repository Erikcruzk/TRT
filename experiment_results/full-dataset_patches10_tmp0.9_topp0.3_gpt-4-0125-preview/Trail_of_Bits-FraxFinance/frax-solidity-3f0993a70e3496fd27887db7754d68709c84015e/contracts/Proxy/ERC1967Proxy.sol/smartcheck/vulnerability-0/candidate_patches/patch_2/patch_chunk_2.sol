// There is no specific function named `beginMigration` in the provided contract code. 
// Given the context and the analysis result pointing to "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" in the ERC1967Proxy, 
// a solution cannot be directly applied without more details on where the locked money issue needs to be addressed.
// However, since there's no direct mention or definition of a `beginMigration` function or any related functionality 
// that could be directly associated with managing or migrating funds in an unsafe manner in the provided contracts, 
// providing a fix for the "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" vulnerability is not feasible without additional context or specific function details.
