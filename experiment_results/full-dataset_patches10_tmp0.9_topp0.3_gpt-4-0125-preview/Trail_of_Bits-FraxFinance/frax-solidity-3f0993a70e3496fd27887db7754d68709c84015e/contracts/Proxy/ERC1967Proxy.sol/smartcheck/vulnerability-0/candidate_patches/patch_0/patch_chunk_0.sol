// This contract does not contain a specific `beginMigration()` function as described in the user's task.
// However, if the task involves addressing the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY vulnerability in the context of potentially 
// adding a migration function to move funds or otherwise interact with the contract's balance, a general template
// for a safe migration function could look like this:

// Note: This template assumes the goal is to create a migration function that safely transfers the contract's balance
// to a new address. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific requirements of the migration process.
