// This code snippet is not directly provided in the question. However, based on the context given, a common vulnerability related to starting a migration in smart contracts involves unchecked permissions. A secure version of a hypothetical `beginMigration` function, addressing common permission-related vulnerabilities, is provided below.

function beginMigration(address newAddress) external onlyOwner {
    require(newAddress != address(0), "Migration: new address is the zero address");
    migrationAddress = newAddress;
    emit MigrationStarted(msg.sender, newAddress);
}
