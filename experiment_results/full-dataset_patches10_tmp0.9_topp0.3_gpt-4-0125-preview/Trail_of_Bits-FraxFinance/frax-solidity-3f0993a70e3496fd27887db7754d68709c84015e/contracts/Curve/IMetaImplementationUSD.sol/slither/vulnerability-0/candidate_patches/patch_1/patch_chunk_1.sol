// This is an example implementation assuming you want to fix a hypothetical vulnerability in a migration function. 
// Since the original vulnerability wasn't specifically about a "beginMigration" function, and such function was not provided, 
// below is a generic secure example of how one might safely implement a migration initiation function in Solidity based on common best practices.
