// The provided code does not contain a function explicitly named beginMigration(). 
// Since no specific function with the vulnerability was pointed out in the context, 
// and the vulnerability mentioned refers to a constructor which might be misleading 
// in the presented analysis, here's a correction for potential issues related to the 
// "shadowing" warning in Solidity, aiming to clarify constructor usage in the context of Solidity 0.4.21.

// Correcting potential misunderstanding by explicitly defining a constructor for AbyssToken 
// to avoid any confusion with function naming and ensuring compliance with Solidity's best practices.
