This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

slither Analysis Results
Vulnerability: locked-ether found in the following piece of code:

    function () public payable {

        revert();


The contract is among the source code below:



pragma solidity 0.4.24;


contract RevertFallback {
    function () public payable {
        revert();
    }

    function receiveEth() public payable {

    }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
