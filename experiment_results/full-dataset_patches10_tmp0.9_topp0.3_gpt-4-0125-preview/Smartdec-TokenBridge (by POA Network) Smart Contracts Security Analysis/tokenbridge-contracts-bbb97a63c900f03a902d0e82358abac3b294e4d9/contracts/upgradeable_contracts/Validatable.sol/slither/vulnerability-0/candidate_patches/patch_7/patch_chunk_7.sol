// There's no specific function provided to fix, and the described vulnerability isn't directly related to a specific function but to the initialization of state variables. Since the user requests the beginMigration function which isn't provided, I'll create a conceptual `beginMigration` function that includes relevant safety checks for an uninitialized state variable scenario, assuming it's related to setting up or modifying the `addressStorage` mapping, particularly for the "validatorContract".

pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract MigrationExample is EternalStorage {
    address public owner;
    bool private migrationStarted;

    event MigrationStarted(address initiator);
    event ValidatorContractAddressSet(address validatorContractAddress);

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can perform this action.");
        _;
    }

    modifier migrationNotStarted() {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration has already been started.");
        _;
    }

    function beginMigration(address _newValidatorContractAddress) public onlyOwner migrationNotStarted {
        require(_newValidatorContractAddress != address(0), "Validator contract address cannot be zero.");
        // Ensure the address isn't already set to prevent overwriting. This could be adjusted based on desired logic.
        require(addressStorage[keccak256(abi.encodePacked("validatorContract"))] == address(0), "Validator contract address is already set.");

        addressStorage[keccak256(abi.encodePacked("validatorContract"))] = _newValidatorContractAddress;
        migrationStarted = true;

        emit MigrationStarted(msg.sender);
        emit ValidatorContractAddressSet(_newValidatorContractAddress);
    }
}
