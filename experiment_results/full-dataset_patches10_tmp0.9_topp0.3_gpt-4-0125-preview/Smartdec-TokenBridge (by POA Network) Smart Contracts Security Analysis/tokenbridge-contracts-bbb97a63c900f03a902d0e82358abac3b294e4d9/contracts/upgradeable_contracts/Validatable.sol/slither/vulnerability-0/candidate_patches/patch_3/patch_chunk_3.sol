// This is an updated version of the beginMigration function or an initialization method to ensure
// addressStorage mapping is initialized properly within the context described. Since the original

// pattern for initialization or migration within smart contracts that involve setting a value in
// addressStorage.

    // it should be implemented here to ensure only authorized addresses can trigger migration.
