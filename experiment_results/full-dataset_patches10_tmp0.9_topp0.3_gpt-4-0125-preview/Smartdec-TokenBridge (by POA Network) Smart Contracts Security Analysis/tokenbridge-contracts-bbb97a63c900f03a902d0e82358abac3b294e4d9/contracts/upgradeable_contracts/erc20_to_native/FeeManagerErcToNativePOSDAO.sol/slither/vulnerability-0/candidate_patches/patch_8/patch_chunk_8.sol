// This function is not present in the provided contract code. 
// Based on the context, it seems the user is asking for a function that might initiate or prepare for migration,
// which typically involves setting up new contract addresses or similar preparatory steps.
// Given this, and aiming to address the uninitialized-state issue highlighted in the analysis,
// a sample `beginMigration()` function is provided below with a focus on initializing state variables properly,
// though it's important to note the original contracts did not include such a function.

function beginMigration(address newAddress) public {
