// This code snippet does not directly include a beginMigration function or a function related to locking money inappropriately in the provided contracts. 
// Based on the given smart contract code and the vulnerability report, there doesn't seem to be a specific function named beginMigration or an explicit vulnerability 
// related to locked money directly in the provided functions. The vulnerability might be misunderstood or misattributed in the analysis results given. 
// The provided contracts focus on upgradeability and proxy patterns without a direct implementation of funds handling or a migration function that locks money.
// If a function to begin a migration process, which could potentially lock funds, is needed, it's not part of the provided contract code snippets.
