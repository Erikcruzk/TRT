// This contract does not contain a specific "beginMigration" function or a directly mentioned "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" vulnerability in the given code.
// However, based on the context provided and assuming you're asking for improvements to mitigate common issues including state mutability and locking money in contracts,
// below is a dummy "beginMigration" function intended for demonstration. This should be integrated following your contract's design logic.

// Note: Since the original contract does not directly specify such a function or vulnerability, the following is an illustrative example.
