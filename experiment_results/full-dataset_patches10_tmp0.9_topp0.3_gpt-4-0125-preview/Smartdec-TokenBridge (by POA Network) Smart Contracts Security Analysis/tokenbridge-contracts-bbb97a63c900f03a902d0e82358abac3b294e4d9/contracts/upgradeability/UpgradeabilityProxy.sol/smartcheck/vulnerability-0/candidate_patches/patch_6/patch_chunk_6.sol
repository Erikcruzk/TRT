// This contract does not contain a specific "beginMigration" function or a directly mentioned "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" vulnerability in the given code.
// However, based on the context provided and assuming you're asking for improvements to mitigate common issues including state mutability and locking money in contracts,
// below is a dummy "beginMigration" function intended for demonstration. This should be integrated following your contract's design logic.

// Note: Since the original contract does not directly specify such a function or vulnerability, the following is an illustrative example.

pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract Migration {
    address private owner;
    bool private migrationStarted;

    event MigrationStarted();

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        migrationStarted = false;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    function beginMigration() public onlyOwner {
        require(!migrationStarted, "Migration has already started");
        migrationStarted = true;
        emit MigrationStarted();
    }
}
