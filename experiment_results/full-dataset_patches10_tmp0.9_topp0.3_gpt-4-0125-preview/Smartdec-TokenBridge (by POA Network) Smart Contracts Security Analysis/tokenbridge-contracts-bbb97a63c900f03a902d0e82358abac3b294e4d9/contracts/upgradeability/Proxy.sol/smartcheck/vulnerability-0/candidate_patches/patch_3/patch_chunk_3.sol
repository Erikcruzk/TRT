// This contract does not contain a function named "beginMigration", nor does it exhibit a direct "SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY" vulnerability within a specific function.
// The provided contract code demonstrates a fallback function used to delegate calls to another contract, but it doesn't include functionality to withdraw funds,
// thus inherently not locking funds directly through its own logic. The contract snippet given doesn't feature the "beginMigration" function or any explicit financial logic.
