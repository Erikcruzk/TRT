// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration(), 
// and the provided code does not directly indicate a locked money vulnerability related to a specific function.
// The vulnerability warning from the analyzer likely refers to the design pattern used (Proxy pattern) 
// and not to a specific vulnerability in a function named beginMigration().
// Since there's no specific beginMigration() function to fix according to the user's request, 
// and addressing the SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY warning would require structural changes outside the scope of a single function repair.
