// This contract does not contain a function named beginMigration().
// However, the provided code snippet shows that the fallback function is handling incoming Ether transfers.
// The vulnerability concern was about the contract potentially locking money without a way to withdraw it.
// Since there's no specific beginMigration() function in the provided snippet, here's the fallback function with a comment suggesting to ensure mechanisms for handling Ether are properly managed.
