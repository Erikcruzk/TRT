// This contract does not contain a specific function named `beginMigration`. 
// Given the provided description and the focus on the uninitialized-state vulnerability 
// related to the `_version` variable, there seems to be a misunderstanding or missing context.

// However, to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability concern for `_version`, 
// initializing this variable in a constructor or a specific initialization function 
// would be a standard approach. Below is an illustrative example of how you might modify the contract 
// to include initialization logic for the `_version` variable, assuming that's the intended fix:

pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    uint256 internal _version;
    address internal _implementation;

    // Constructor to initialize the state variables
    constructor(uint256 initialVersion, address initialImplementation) public {
        _version = initialVersion;
        _implementation = initialImplementation;
    }

    function version() public view returns (uint256) {
        return _version;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
