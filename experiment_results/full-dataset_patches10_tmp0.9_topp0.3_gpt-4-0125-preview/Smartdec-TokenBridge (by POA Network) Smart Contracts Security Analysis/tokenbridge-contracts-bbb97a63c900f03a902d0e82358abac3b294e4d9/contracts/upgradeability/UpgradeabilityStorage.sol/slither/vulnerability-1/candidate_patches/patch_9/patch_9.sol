// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration().
// However, the uninitialized-state vulnerability report refers to the state variable:
// address internal _implementation;
// There is no explicit function or code snippet directly manipulating or initializing it
// in the provided contract snippet. To address the uninitialized-state vulnerability,
// you might consider initializing state variables in a constructor or through an
// initialization function, but without a clear context or requirement on how
// _implementation should be initialized or used, it's challenging to provide a precise fix.
// Below is an illustrative example of initializing the state variable in a constructor
// or an initialization function, which would be a general approach to address such vulnerability.
