// This contract does not contain the specific function beginMigration(), and no vulnerable function was directly provided.
// Given the analysis result, there's no direct function to fix based on the provided details.
// However, to address the uninitialized-state vulnerability mentioned for the `_version` variable, 
// ensuring it's properly initialized in a constructor or a function could mitigate such issues.
// Since the task mentions fixing a function named `beginMigration()` which is not present, 
// below is a hypothetical approach to initialize the `_version` variable properly in a constructor, 
// which could be a part of addressing the uninitialized-state vulnerability.
