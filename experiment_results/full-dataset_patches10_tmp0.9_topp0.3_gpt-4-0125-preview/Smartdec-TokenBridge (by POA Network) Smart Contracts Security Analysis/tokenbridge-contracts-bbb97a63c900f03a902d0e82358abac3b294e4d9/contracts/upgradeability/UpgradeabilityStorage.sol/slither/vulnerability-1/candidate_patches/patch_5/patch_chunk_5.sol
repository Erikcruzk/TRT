// The provided code does not contain a specific function called beginMigration() or any other function with a notable vulnerability related to uninitialized-state. 
// The Slither analysis report mentions an uninitialized-state vulnerability related to the variable `address internal _implementation;` 
// However, this variable is a state variable and not part of a function. The issue could relate to ensuring that `_implementation` is initialized properly, 
// possibly within a constructor or an initialization function which is not provided in the given code snippet. 

// Since no specific function called beginMigration() or any function is provided in the question, and the issue is not directly about a function but a state variable,
// it's not possible to provide a corrected function code based on the given details.

// For completeness, in a scenario where initialization is the concern, ensuring proper initialization could look like this in a constructor or an initialization method, 
// which is not directly related to the given code but addresses the uninitialized-state concern in a general context.

contract ExampleInitializationContract {
    address internal _implementation;

    constructor(address initialImplementation) public {
        _implementation = initialImplementation;
    }
}

// Note: This is a hypothetical example addressing the uninitialized state issue in a general context, not a direct correction of a function because the required function was not provided.
