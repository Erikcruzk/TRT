This Solidity Smart Contract has been analyzed by smart contract analyzers. Here are the results from these analyzers.

slither Analysis Results
Vulnerability: uninitialized-state found in the following piece of code:

    address internal _implementation;


The contract is among the source code below:



pragma solidity 0.4.24;






contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    
    uint256 internal _version;

    
    address internal _implementation;

    



    function version() public view returns (uint256) {
        return _version;
    }

    



    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}

DO NOT return natural language for explanations, only the Solidity code of the vulnerable function (if it is a function otherwise whole contract).
