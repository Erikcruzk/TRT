// This contract does not contain a function named `beginMigration`, 
// and there's no specific function provided to fix based on the initial request.
// Given the vulnerability highlighted pertains to an uninitialized state variable,
// there's no direct function to correct without a broader context or specific requirements.
// As such, here's a revised version of the entire contract with an initialized state variable as an example:

pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract UpgradeabilityStorage {
    uint256 internal _version = 1;  // Initializing the _version variable to an example value
    address internal _implementation;

    function version() public view returns (uint256) {
        return _version;
    }

    function implementation() public view returns (address) {
        return _implementation;
    }
}
