// There is no specific beginMigration() function in the provided contract code.
// However, if the issue is related to a missing function that might handle migration 
// or initialization aspects safely, here's an example of a secure initialization function:

pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract ClassicEternalStorageProxy is EternalStorage, OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy {
    bool private initialized;

    event MigrationStarted();

    function beginMigration() public onlyProxyOwner {
        require(!initialized, "Migration has already been started");
        initialized = true;
        emit MigrationStarted();
    }
}
