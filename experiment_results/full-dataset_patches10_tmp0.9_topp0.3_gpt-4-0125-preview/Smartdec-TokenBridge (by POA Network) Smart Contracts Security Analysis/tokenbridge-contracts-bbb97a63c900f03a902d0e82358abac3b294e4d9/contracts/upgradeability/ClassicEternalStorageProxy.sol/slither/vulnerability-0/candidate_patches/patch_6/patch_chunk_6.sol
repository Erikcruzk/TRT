// This contract does not contain a specific function named beginMigration().
// However, to address the uninitialized state variable warning by slither for uintStorage 
// and assuming a scenario where a beginMigration function could be relevant, an example resolution could be:

pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract ClassicEternalStorageProxy is EternalStorage, OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy {
    // Example function to initialize a value in uintStorage to demonstrate fixing the uninitialized-state vulnerability.
    function beginMigration(bytes32 key, uint256 value) public onlyProxyOwner {
        uintStorage[key] = value;
    }
}
