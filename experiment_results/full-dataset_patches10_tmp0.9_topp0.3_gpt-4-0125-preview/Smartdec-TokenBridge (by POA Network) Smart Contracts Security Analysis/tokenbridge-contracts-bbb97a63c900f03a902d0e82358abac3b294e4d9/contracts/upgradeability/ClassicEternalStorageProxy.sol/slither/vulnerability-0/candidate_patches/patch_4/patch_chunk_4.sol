// This code snippet does not directly correspond to a specific function marked as vulnerable by the provided analysis.
// However, the mention of the 'uninitialized-state' vulnerability in context with 'mapping(bytes32 => uint256) internal uintStorage;'
// suggests an issue with how mappings are initialized or used without proper checks or setup in the broader contract context.
// Since mappings in Solidity cannot be directly initialized, the vulnerability notice might be due to how it's used or not properly checked in functions.
// Given the provided contracts, there's no explicit function to fix based on the analysis output directly pointing at 'beginMigration' or similar.
// Please ensure that mappings are correctly used with appropriate checks or initializations in your contract functions or setup logic.
