The user did not provide the specific function (`beginMigration`) they are concerned about within their provided smart contract code or any other context. Given only the interface `INRERC20` was included in the user's message, and no actual contract or function named `beginMigration` was provided, it is not possible to give a compilable version of a function named `beginMigration` that fixes a vulnerability because the function itself was never specified or included in the user's initial query.
