// The provided code is an interface definition rather than a smart contract with a function implementation.
// Interfaces in Solidity are not capable of containing vulnerabilities as they only define function signatures
// without any implementation. Thus, it's not possible to provide a "beginMigration()" function or fix vulnerabilities
// within this context since the provided code does not contain any implementations or the mentioned function.
