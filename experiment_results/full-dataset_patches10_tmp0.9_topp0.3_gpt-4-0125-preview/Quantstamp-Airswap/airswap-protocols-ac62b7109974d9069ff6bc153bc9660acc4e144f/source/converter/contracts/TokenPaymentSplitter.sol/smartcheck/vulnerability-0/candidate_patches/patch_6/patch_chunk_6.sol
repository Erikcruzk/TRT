// The provided Solidity code does not contain a function explicitly named beginMigration(). 
// Given the request, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication 
// about the specific vulnerability or function to be fixed.
//
// However, based on the provided code and the analysis result mentioning SOLIDITY_LOCKED_MONEY
// in the context of the TokenPaymentSplitter abstract contract, there's no direct function or 
// mechanism shown that directly leads to the "locked money" situation as described typically by 
// funds being unable to be moved due to logic errors or lack of functionality.
//
// If the intention was to ensure that the TokenPaymentSplitter contract can receive and split 
// Ether among multiple accounts according to their shares, the existing contract requires 
// implementation of a function to distribute funds or a fallback function to accept Ether transactions.
// Below is an example of a non-existent function that could hypothetically address receiving and 
// distributing Ether, assuming this was the intention. Note that this is purely speculative based on 
// the prompt and not directly derived from provided code:

function distributeEther() public payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "No ether sent");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _payees.length; i++) {
        address payable payeeAddress = payable(_payees[i]);
        uint256 payment = (msg.value * _shares[_payees[i]]) / _totalShares;
        payeeAddress.transfer(payment);
    }
}

// Remember to carefully review your requirements and ensure that the function names and 
// vulnerabilities match the provided or requested fix.
