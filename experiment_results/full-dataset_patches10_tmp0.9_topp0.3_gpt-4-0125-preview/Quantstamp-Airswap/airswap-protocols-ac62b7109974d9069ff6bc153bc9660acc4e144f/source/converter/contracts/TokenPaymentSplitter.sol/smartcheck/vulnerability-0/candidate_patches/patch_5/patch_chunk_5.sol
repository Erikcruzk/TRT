// The provided code does not include a function named `beginMigration` nor does it explicitly
// present a locked money vulnerability based on the given analyzer feedback and code listing.
// If the concern is about potential locked funds in `TokenPaymentSplitter`, a function to 
// release or distribute funds is not found in the given code, which could be considered a
