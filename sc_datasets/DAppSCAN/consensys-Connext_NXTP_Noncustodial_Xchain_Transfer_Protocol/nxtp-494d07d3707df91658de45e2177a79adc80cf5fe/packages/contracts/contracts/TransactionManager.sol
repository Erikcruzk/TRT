/**
 *
 * @title TransactionManager
 * @author Connext <support@connext.network>
 * @notice This contract holds the logic to facilitate crosschain transactions.
 *         Transactions go through three phases in the happy case:
 *
 *         1. Route Auction (offchain): User broadcasts to our network 
 *         signalling their desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids 
 *         containing commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a 
 *         certain time and price range.
 *
 *         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be 
 *         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` 
 *         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This 
 *         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chain. Upon 
 *         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, 
 *         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the 
 *         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of 
 *         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending 
 *         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the 
 *         transaction.
 *
 *         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the 
 *         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a 
 *         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may 
 *         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` 
 *         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the 
 *         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users 
 *         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving 
 *         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the 
 *         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, 
 *         unlocking the original `amount`.
 *
 *         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it 
 *         reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on 
 *         each chain (initiator). Additionally, transactions can be cancelled 
 *         unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for 
 *         sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry.
 *
 *         NOTE on internal accounting:
 *         To properly handle the cases where a token is rebasing/inflationary/
 *         deflationary, we think of funds sent to the contracts as claiming
 *         "shares" of the total balance of the contract, rather than tracking
 *         raw balances. This allows routers to keep earning inflation rewards
 *         when providing liquidity aTokens, for example. Shares are
 *         created and issued when the contract receives funds, and burned when
 *         the contract disburses funds. During a crosschain transaction, they
 *         are deducted from the routers issued shares.
