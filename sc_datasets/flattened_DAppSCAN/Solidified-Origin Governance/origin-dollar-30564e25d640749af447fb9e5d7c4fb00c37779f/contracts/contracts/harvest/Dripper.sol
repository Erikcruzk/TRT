/**
 * @title OUSD Dripper
 *
 * The dripper contract smooths out the yield from point-in-time yield events
 * and spreads the yield out over a configurable time period. This ensures a
 * continuous per block yield to makes users happy as their next rebase
 * amount is always moving up. Also, this makes historical day to day yields
 * smooth, rather than going from a near zero day, to a large APY day, then
 * back to a near zero day again.
 *
 *
 * Design notes
 * - USDT has a smaller resolution than the number of seconds
 * in a week, which can make per block payouts have a rounding error. However
 * the total effect is not large - cents per day, and this money is
 * not lost, just distributed in the future. While we could use a higher
 * decimal precision for the drip perBlock, we chose simpler code.
 * - By calculating the changing drip rates on collects only, harvests and yield
 * events don't have to call anything on this contract or pay any extra gas.
 * Collect() is already be paying for a single write, since it has to reset
 * the lastCollect time.
 * - By having a collectAndRebase method, and having our external systems call
 * that, the OUSD vault does not need any changes, not even to know the address
 * of the dripper.
 * - A rejected design was to retro-calculate the drip rate on each collect,
 * based on the balance at the time of the collect. While this would have
 * required less state, and would also have made the contract respond more quickly
 * to new income, it would break the predictability that is this contract's entire
 * purpose. If we did this, the amount of fundsAvailable() would make sharp increases
 * when funds were deposited.
 * - When the dripper recalculates the rate, it targets spending the balance over
 * the duration. This means that every time that collect is is called, if no
 * new funds have been deposited the duration is being pushed back and the
 * rate decreases. This is expected, and ends up following a smoother but
 * longer curve the more collect() is called without incoming yield.
 *
