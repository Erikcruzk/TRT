 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in

 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on `{IERC20-approve}`, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
